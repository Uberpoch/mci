							<h1>Critical Challenges Ahead for Medicare Advantage Plans</h1>
<p>Healthcare payers currently face multiple financial challenges with Medicare Advantage plans. A recent boost in post-pandemic patient confidence and reimbursement changes are creating significant hurdles for many payers. So, protecting revenue has become a high priority.</p>
<p>Carenet Health<sup>&reg;</sup> offers a suite of services that tap into the rise of healthcare consumerism to help payers maintain profitability and strengthen their financial foundation and future. These are tools that support the business of healthcare through insightful consultation, technological innovation and personalization that boosts the customer experience.</p>
<h2>Post-COVID Medicare Advantage-Payer Landscape</h2>
<p>Health services utilization has lagged for several years due to continuing fear and discomfort from the COVID-19 pandemic. But now, an increasing number of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries are headed back to the doctor for routine appointments or to the hospital for elective procedures. This uptick in inpatient and outpatient utilization is substantial. And, as many organizations <a href="https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/finance/why-more-organizations-are-terminating-medicare-advantage-contracts">terminate their Medicare Advantage contracts</a>, major commercial payers that are responsible for covering these visits and procedures are feeling financial pressure.</p>
<p>In April, the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) added another layer of financial concern when it levied a cap on Medicare Advantage payments for the coming year. Rather than the anticipated 4.7% increase, the agency revealed reimbursements will <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-finalizes-payment-updates-2025-medicare-advantage-and-medicare-part-d-programs">only rise by an average of 3.7%</a>. The reimbursement raise is even smaller when adjusted for costs and inflation.</p>
<p>Between the tidal wave of medical costs and smaller payment rates, payers now feel the pinch. Many are panicking amid <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payers/cvs-lowers-2024-guidance-it-misses-profit-revenue-q1">double-digit stock price tumbles and benefit-expense ratios hovering between 85-90%</a>.</p>
<h3>The Path to Recovery</h3>
<p>Fortunately, the road to financial recovery for many payers exists. However, the path may be winding in an environment where patients expect more choices and control over their healthcare decisions. In fact, <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/what-health-systems-need-to-win-in-every-market.html?origin=BHRSUN&amp;utm_source=BHRSUN&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=newsletter&amp;oly_enc_id=3569J3039134G6X">45% of consumers research plans before choosing one</a>, and 44% do the same before choosing a specific provider.</p>
<p>But attempting to reduce medical spending and secure optimal reimbursement alone is a tall task for any payer. Instead, payers can benefit from collaborating with an experienced partner that has expertise in both navigating all facets of Medicare Advantage and working directly with members, says John Erwin, chief executive officer of healthcare support service, care management and consumer engagement company Carenet Health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We offer a very compelling solution set that helps payers preserve as much revenue as possible. Our goal is to help lower their medical spend and help them operate as efficiently as possible,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We are armed with perspective from over 500 premier healthcare partners, and we are primed to assist with cutting the cost of care and maximizing administrative savings.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>The Carenet Health Strategy</strong></h2>
<p>Overall, Erwin says, Carenet can leverage its Intelligent Engagement&trade; model to address payers&rsquo; financial needs through standardized engagement strategies that directly reach members. These tactics focus on membership growth and satisfaction, star ratings and risk adjustment, and cost control and spending.</p>
<h3><strong>Membership acquisition and retention: </strong></h3>
<p>Attracting and acquiring new members is vital. In fact, retaining members for the first two years is critical for customers. Targeted marketing efforts can help organizations educate potential members about coverage options, benefits, premiums, deductibles, co-payments and networks. These efforts work best when individuals have multiple channels for accessing information and receiving assistance.</p>
<p>Payers can use these same avenues to introduce renewal activities as members approach the end of a coverage period. These efforts can include incentives, personalized plan recommendation and plan selection guidance. The end result is two-fold: coverage renewal and long-term, loyal member relationships.</p>
<h3><strong>Strengthening membership: </strong></h3>
<p>Welcome calls, onboarding initiatives and enrollment in wellness programs can help members feel comfortable with a new plan. Carenet&rsquo;s advanced customer relations management platform also contributes to a personalized healthcare experience and leads to better coordinated care and improved outcomes.</p>
<h3><strong>Star ratings and risk adjustment:</strong></h3>
<p>Star ratings are more vital than ever as members are becoming more discerning with their healthcare dollars. Carenet&rsquo;s CX Analytics Group has more than 15 years&rsquo; experience gathering details from over 200 different healthcare areas, including patient experiences and insights. This information helps payers design care plans that best fit their clients&rsquo; needs.</p>
<p>In addition to star rating improvement efforts, Carenet also provides health risk assessment (HRA) support. For example, its HRA evaluation questionnaire helps payers identify any gaps in patient engagement so they target their efforts to each member&rsquo;s individual needs. This tool can also assist payers in finding the best avenues to improve communication with members such as text messages, emails or phone calls.</p>
<h3><strong>HEDIS<sup>&reg;</sup> Scores: </strong></h3>
<p>HEDIS<sup>&reg;</sup> improvement initiatives can also boost plan performance. Carenet&rsquo;s year-long strategy directly engages members to identify gaps in care that need to be addressed. The company promotes member activity through plain-language resources that explain the importance of preventive health services. And it can help payers create engagement teams to identify members&rsquo; barriers to care. By embracing telehealth and meeting members where they are via multichannel outreach strategies, HEDIS improvement programs can positively impact members choices and activities.</p>
<h3><strong>Cost control and spending:</strong></h3>
<p>Reigning in medical spending is paramount to each payer&rsquo;s financial survival. Carenet can help payers with this reduction in five ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collaborations with providers:</strong> Carenet&rsquo;s Shared Decision Making solution encourages patients to collaborate with providers to choose the best treatment options. By using analytics, health coaching and decision aids patients and their providers can make the most informed decisions about a range of conditions. The ultimate result can be improved patient satisfaction and a reduction in the cost of care.</li>
<li><strong>Lower emergency department (ED) utilization: </strong>Members have easy access to care with Carenet&rsquo;s Virtual Clinic, 24/7 Nurse Advice Line and Behavioral Health crisis support. By introducing the Virtual Clinic, some payers have seen a 67% drop in costs, and the Behavior Health crisis support helps 95% of patients avoid an ED visit. In addition, remote patient monitoring and health coaching can help reduce ED utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced hospital stays:</strong> Carenet&rsquo;s clinical support teams also complete early and frequent follow-up patients upon hospital discharge. By identifying and intervening as soon as possible with any complications, these healthcare providers can lower member costs and improve outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Fewer readmissions:</strong> Better transitions of care can help members avoid costly hospital readmissions. To limit these expenses for payers, Carenet can proactively schedule patients who have a referral from their primary care provider to see a specialist. Streamlining the scheduling process boosts adherence and improves outcomes and patient satisfaction. It also ensures greater continuity of care.</li>
<li><strong>Steerage via providers:</strong> Patients who stay in-network for the health services incur lower costs. Carenet educates primary care providers on how to best refer patients to in-network hospitals and specialists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, Carenet has the expertise and tools to promote healthcare consumerism among members and help payers navigate these uncertain Medicare Advantage waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our solutions can help payers overcome these market challenges,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We are uniquely positioned to offer support at this moment healthcare.&rdquo;</p>

							<p>When the COVID-19-era continuous enrollment period for Medicaid ended in spring 2023, states resumed routine disenrollment processes.</p>
<p>This left many health plans and payers scrambling to connect with beneficiaries and complete redetermination requirements.</p>
<p>At Carenet, we help clients keep their Medicaid enrollees covered and engaged. Through our healthcare call center outreach, we also help health plans improve their members&rsquo; experience while helping to achieve their business goals of driving revenue and managing costs.</p>
<h2>The Significance of Successful Medicaid Redetermination</h2>
<p>Medicaid is a lifeline for more than <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/10-things-to-know-about-the-unwinding-of-the-medicaid-continuous-enrollment-provision/___.YXAzOmNhcmVuZXRoZWFsdGg6YTpvOmFhNGMyZmMwN2UyYmQ5YjIyMjU2N2RhODU5NTM4NGMyOjY6M2QzZTpjMjkwYmNiYmE2ODliMGMxNGU3OWZiZGZlZjRmZTc2ZjU2NTk0MjdiOTQwMzk4MzdmNWNjZTU4NjY5YmMzN2Y5OnA6VA">90 million U.S. adults and children</a>. The continuous enrollment offered during the pandemic ensured healthcare access for vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without annual renewal requirements for the past few years, many Medicaid beneficiaries have moved or become difficult to reach,&rdquo; says Shawna Knight, director of client operations and clinical services for Carenet. &ldquo;This means millions of people stand to lose coverage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, Knight adds, loss of Medicaid coverage is about so much more than loss of health insurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When people lose Medicaid coverage, they often lose other benefits, like transportation and access to meal programs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bottom line is that Medicaid turnover rates are costly in many ways.</p>
<p>Carenet&rsquo;s Medicaid redetermination support services can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent coverage gaps: Maintaining coverage prevents healthcare access issues, which can lead to delayed or skipped medical care.</li>
<li>Preserve revenue: Re-enrolling Medicaid members guarantees payments for providers and associated premiums for health plans.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Carenet Can Help with Medicaid Redetermination</h2>
<p>Even though the big post-Pandemic redetermination process may have subsided, this is still a critically important process for Medicaid plans. To help in this effort, Carenet collaborates with health plans to conduct direct outreach and member engagement. Our engagement solutions team drives individual changes that lead to big impacts.</p>
<p>By seeking Carenet&rsquo;s help with redetermination, organizations can ensure their eligible beneficiaries take necessary steps to retain coverage. Carenet offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience: Our engagement solutions team has more than 370k member interactions daily.</li>
<li>Expertise: Our enrollment and eligibility experts understand the Medicaid redetermination process. They work with beneficiaries to ensure all necessary documentation is gathered and submitted correctly.</li>
<li>Compliance: Carenet experts ensure your organization stays in compliance with all relevant Medicaid rules and regulations.</li>
<li>Efficiency: Our Carenet team can reduce administrative burdens, allowing organizations to focus on other essential tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Medicaid Redetermination: Member Engagement Success Stories</h2>
<p>When it comes to Medicaid redetermination, each state is doing things differently &mdash; and each has a different <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Carenet_RedeterminationList_Update.pdf___.YXAzOmNhcmVuZXRoZWFsdGg6YTpvOmFhNGMyZmMwN2UyYmQ5YjIyMjU2N2RhODU5NTM4NGMyOjY6MDAxYjo4MjMzM2UzMWJkMzNkZDFmNjMwM2QzNTNlNTIzYTA4NmIyNDFhNzgzMzZjZDI0MjAwNjA4ZDE0MjcwOWRmNGVkOnA6VA">redetermination deadline</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each Carenet client has unique timing needs and a sense of urgency,&rdquo; says Knight. &ldquo;We can tailor our support and quickly scale to meet their needs.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Reaching Medicaid Enrollees in California</h3>
<p>A California-based Medicaid plan administrator used text messages to initially reach out to its members. Carenet used its medical call center to follow up directly with the members who left their texts unanswered.</p>
<p>The Carenet team reached thousands of members and successfully guided them through the Medicaid redetermination process.</p>
<p><strong>Success Snapshot</strong></p>
<p><strong>11,228</strong> contacts</p>
<p><strong>95%</strong> success rate</p>
<h3>Medicaid Redetermination Success in Texas</h3>
<p>One Texas-based, child-focused health maintenance organization (HMO) called on Carenet to assist with their Medicaid redetermination process. They mailed redetermination packets to members and relied on Carenet&rsquo;s medical call center to make follow-up calls.</p>
<p>Carenet client services connected with thousands of members, ensuring each understood the Medicaid re-enrollment requirements and, in many cases, walked them through packet completion.</p>
<p><strong>320,471</strong> dialed calls</p>
<p><strong>97.2%</strong> success rate</p>
<h2>Overcoming Medicaid Redetermination Challenges</h2>
<p>Medicaid redetermination is a complex process for beneficiaries and the organizations administering Medicaid programs. Challenges include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documentation burden: Beneficiaries may struggle to gather the required documentation, such as proof of income, citizenship or residency, leading to delays in the redetermination process.</li>
<li>Eligibility changes: Life circumstances change quickly, making it difficult for individuals to accurately report changes in income, family size or employment status.</li>
<li>Administrative complexity: Organizations responsible for managing Medicaid benefits may have limited resources and face administrative burdens in processing redetermination applications for their members.</li>
</ul>
<p>Partnering with Carenet through the Medicaid redetermination process can help organizations streamline their administrative processes and ensure their members can navigate the complexities of Medicaid reenrollment.</p>

							<p>Unpredictable things can happen &ndash; natural disasters, weather emergencies, and other unforeseen circumstances can close your healthcare facility with little warning. When events like these happen, real-time communication with your patients is vital to maintain satisfaction and provide a positive patient experience. Patient broadcast messaging via text message can be the easiest and quickest way to contact your patients with urgent notices.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28942 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PatientTextsBlog_ReachAll.png" alt="when a natural disaster or inclement weather strikes it is vital to reach all patients quickly and effiiciently to let them know that the healthcare facility is closed" width="700" height="306"></p><h2 class="blog-subhead">Broadcast Text Messaging is Key to Contacting Patients During Emergency Closures</h2><p>When an emergency closure happens, it can wreak havoc on your schedule and cause an influx of calls, confusion, and frustration. <strong>&nbsp;A patient text messaging solution allows you to communicate quickly and efficiently across a large group of patients when information needs to be shared broadly.</strong></p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28941 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PatientTextsBlog_Important.png" alt="the three most important text message broadcast communications communicating closures sending contact information sharing reopening details" width="700" height="235"></p><p>Here are three important <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-message-broadcast/">text message broadcast</a> communications with examples to guide and inform patients:</p><ul><li>Communicating Closures</li><li>Sending Contact Information</li><li>Sharing Reopening Details</li></ul><h2 class="blog-subhead">Use Patient Text Messaging to Communicate Closures</h2><p>When a natural disaster or inclement weather strikes, it can be unsafe for healthcare facilities to stay open. The conditions can make it dangerous for patients and providers to travel, and loss of power or water supply issues may affect the facility&rsquo;s ability to provide services. The first step in changing patients&rsquo; schedules on a large scale is to communicate the change. This is easily accomplished by sending <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-message-broadcast/">broadcast closure text messages </a>letting all patients know that the provider&rsquo;s office or healthcare facility will be closed and all appointments will need to be rescheduled.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28944 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PatientTextsBlog_Reopened.png" alt="patient broadcast messaging is a convenient way to notify patients and let the m know that the healthcare facility has reopened" width="700" height="306"></p><h2 class="blog-subhead">Send Important Contact Information to Patients</h2><p>When providers cannot make it into the office, make sure patients know how to get in contact with their provider during the service outage in the event that they have an urgent need, such as a prescription refill. One option is an <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CarenetHealth_Nurse-Advice-Line_InfoSheet.pdf"><strong>after-hours nurse triage phone line</strong></a> that can be utilized during an unforeseen closure. When facility closures or canceled appointments happen, it&rsquo;s also important to remind patients to call 9-1-1 in case of an emergency&mdash;even during inclement weather.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28945 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PatientTextsBlog_Triage.png" alt="having an after-hours nurse triage phone line can help facilitate any urgent needs during a potential closure" width="700" height="306"></p><h2 class="blog-subhead">Share Reopening Details with Patients</h2><p>Eventually, your office will be ready to open and start accepting patients again. If you know the reopening date, communicate it to patients in advance to help fill your schedule more quickly. <strong>Rebooking</strong> cancellations and mis<strong>sed appointments are critical to recouping revenue and essential for patient health.</strong></p><p>Rather than calling all patients whose appointments were missed, doctor&rsquo;s office mobile messaging, or <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-message-broadcast">patient broadcast messaging</a>, is a convenient way to notify patients and caregivers that your office has reopened. Include a link for patients to easily reschedule their missed appointment online for ease of use and improved conversion. If your building suffered damage prompting arrival instructions to change, be sure to include these details in an&nbsp;<a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-patient-outreach-solution/">appointment confirmation text.</a></p><h2 class="blog-subhead">Patient Text Messaging Isn&rsquo;t Just for Emergencies</h2><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28943 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PatientTextsBlog_OtherWays.png" alt="other ways healthcare facilities can use a medical broadcast system provider delays or schedule changes construction and entrance changes road closures location and building changes and more" width="700" height="306" data-wp-editing="1"></p><p>Patient broadcast messaging can be powerful in an emergency, but it&rsquo;s also a valuable solution for everyday notifications and alerts, such as flu, RSV, and COVID-19 <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/how-to-promote-flu-and-rsv-vaccination-clinics-to-your-patients-and-members/">vaccine reminders and availability.</a> Streamlining testing and vaccine clinics requires preemptive and well-timed patient communications. Patient text messaging with links to online booking helps our clients educate, promote, and schedule for clinics while reminders ensure appointment times and prescreen requirements are respected.</p><p>Here are a few more ways to utilize a medical broadcast messaging solution:</p><ul><li>Provider delays or schedule changes</li><li>Construction, entrance changes, and road closures</li><li>Location and building changes</li><li>New provider available at your facility</li><li>New office hours or contact information</li><li>Easy inpatient communications</li><li>Virtual waiting room text reminders and check-in messages</li><li>Employee onboarding and communications</li><li>Referral reminders and scheduling texts</li><li>Education, promotion, and scheduling for assessment centers and vaccine clinics</li></ul><p>Natural disasters and unforeseen emergencies are bound to happen in the future; however, your health system can be better prepared by having a&nbsp;<a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-message-broadcast"><strong>patient text messaging solution</strong></a> that allows you to send broadcast communications at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p><p><strong>Engaging with patientsalong their care journey is critically important to drive access, action, and adherence.</strong> <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/contact-carenet-sales/">Talk to us today</a> about implementing text broadcast messaging for your health system or clinic.</p>

							<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services">healthcare call centers</a> do more than serve as an after-hours or overflow service for busy providers and office staff. The best <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare call centers</a> have non-clinical and clinical agents who can answer patient questions quickly and easily, schedule appointments, make referrals, and communicate with patients in their preferred language. However, few healthcare organizations pursue the full range of <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services">call center services</a>, failing to capture their highest value and elevate the personalized human touch that can make for an excellent patient experience.</p><h2 class="blog-subhead">&nbsp;</h2><h2 class="blog-subhead"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28814 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/5-Med-Call-Center-Services-To-Outsource-Blog-3.jpg" alt="by collaborating with employers in your area during open enrollment you can help answer their emplotyees questions and find physicians and schedule screenings and deepen partnerships during annual enrollment" width="700" height="333"></h2><h2 class="blog-subhead">What is the role of a call center in healthcare?</h2><p><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/how-are-healthcare-call-centers-different-than-traditional-call-centers/">Healthcare call centers</a> play a pivotal role in improving healthcare experiences by educating and engaging patients and members, resolving customer issues, and providing exceptional multi-channel customer support. Call centers are the first touchpoint in the healthcare journey for many patients. Healthcare call center outsourcing with a trusted partner can help healthcare organizations <a href="https://access.carenethealthcare.com/blog/outsource-medical-call-center-improve-operational-efficiency">improve efficiency</a>, increase revenue, and solve key customer and workforce challenges.</p><p>At Carenet Health, we partner with our healthcare clients to provide call center services that address specific needs and make a real impact. Our team is trained to provide support for appointment scheduling and rescheduling, prescription refills, health risk assessment, pre-appointment instructions, patient portal and telehealth troubleshooting, open enrollment, and more. Whether they&rsquo;re using a call center for the first time, looking to augment their own call center to handle high call volumes, or undergoing a big transition such as moving to a new EHR, our partners trust Carenet to improve the patient experience and staff efficiencies.</p><p>Here are five underutilized <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare call center services</a> and best practices for healthcare call center outsourcing that you can leverage today to improve <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/what-we-do/engagement-services">patient engagement</a>, drive workforce efficiency, and grow revenue.</p><h2 class="blog-subhead" style="color: #f04b24;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28815 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/5-Med-Call-Center-Services-To-Outsource-Blog_2.jpg" alt="according to the association of american medical colleges aamc the united states is facing a shortage of 54100 to 139000 physicians by 2033" width="700" height="333"></h2><h2 class="blog-subhead" style="color: #f04b24;">1. Primary Care Physician Recapture</h2><p>Every day, patients visit your urgent care centers and emergency departments. One in four indicate they don&rsquo;t have a primary care physician (PCP). Yet, few health systems reach out to patients to make a PCP referral in a timely manner. According to a report from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) projects, the <a href="https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/us-physician-shortage-growing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States will face a shortage of between 54,100 and 139,000 physicians by 2033.</a> With physicians retiring early or changing practices, patients are often unsure where to turn. Connecting patients with a PCP encourages healthy behaviors, improves patient satisfaction, and increases retention and utilization of health system resources.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p><a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BEST PRACTICE: Use healthcare call center services to follow up within a week (or less). Place an outbound call within 24 to 72 hours of a patient&rsquo;s visit to make a physician referral or to schedule an appointment.</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="blog-subhead" style="color: #f04b24;">2. Answer Patient Questions via an Open Enrollment Hotline</h2><p>Partner with large employers in your area to help answer their employees&rsquo; questions, find physicians to meet their needs, schedule screenings, and deepen relationships during their annual benefits enrollment. Employers will appreciate the support, and employees will appreciate individualized attention.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p><a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BEST PRACTICE: Offer a live, 24/7, multilingual hotline where well-qualified, caring agents can answer questions and provide a personalized experience.</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="blog-subhead" style="color: #f04b24;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28813 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/5-Med-Call-Center-Services-To-Outsource-Blog-4.jpg" alt="explore healthcare call center outsourcing options to conduct outbound campaigns to thank patients for their time and make sure they get to the right provider" width="700" height="333"></h2><h2 class="blog-subhead" style="color: #f04b24;">3. Answer Patient Questions following an Online Health Risk Assessment</h2><p>Patient self-service and seeking answers online have become commonplace in the healthcare industry. But when patients take online tests, quizzes, or health risk assessments to see if they&rsquo;re at risk for stroke, diabetes, or other conditions, what happens next? Some patients are hesitant to reach out, and your treatment teams rarely have extra time to follow up since they prioritize in-person care. <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Healthcare call centers</a> have specialized clinical teams that are qualified to call patients, ask and answer questions, and recommend next steps. Opt for <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare call center outsourcing</a> to conduct outbound campaigns to thank patients for their time and make sure they get to the right provider. Some patients may simply need a referral to a health coach, while others may be at higher risk or have more acute needs that require a more immediate response.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p><a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-intelligent-scheduling-solution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BEST PRACTICE: Risk-stratify patients and prioritize outreach accordingly.</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="blog-subhead" style="color: #f04b24;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28812 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/5-Med-Call-Center-Services-To-Outsource-Blog-5.jpg" alt="As you increase your patient portal capabilities it is vital to offer multilingual support to walk patients through portal set-up, help nem navigae the system and demonstrate how it is of value to them as a communication tool" width="700" height="333"></h2><h2 class="blog-subhead" style="color: #f04b24;">4. Patient Portal and Telehealth Assistance</h2><p>Patient usage and familiarity with your health system&rsquo;s portal have always been important, but since the COVID-19 pandemic, their significance has skyrocketed. Patient portals are the gateway to scheduling, billing, test results, and telehealth services. Some systems now require patients to be portal users to take advantage of hybrid care. If your organization introduces a new EHR, expect call volume to increase as offices are often flooded with calls when changing portals. Health systems want patients to work through their patient portal but don&rsquo;t always have sufficient support or resources to answer questions and troubleshoot issues. It&rsquo;s like offering a software service without a customer service team. As you increase your emphasis on your patient portal, you must also increase your support. Offer a <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multilingual hotline</a> to walk patients through portal set-up, help them navigate through the system, and demonstrate its value as a patient communication tool. For one of our clients in 2020, our healthcare call center services team supported over 130,000 callers, which consisted of both patients and employees. 14% of the callers needed assistance with registration/activation of their portal, 22% of callers were experiencing login issues, and 13% were locked out of their portal accounts. Moreover, 16% of these calls were for patients preparing for telehealth visits. For <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/impact-of-telehealth-on-patient-scheduling-healthcare-access/">telehealth calls,</a> our agents helped callers load the appropriate app onto their phones and walked them through the app process&mdash;ultimately preparing them for a successful virtual visit.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p><a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-intelligent-scheduling-solution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BEST PRACTICE: Follow up calls with an informational email and &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; video link for future reference.</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="blog-subhead" style="color: #f04b24;">5. Healthcare Call Center Services Can Support Health &amp; Wellness Campaigns</h2><p>When healthcare facilities closed and elective procedures were suspended during the early COVID-19 pandemic, many patients canceled preventative appointments like mammograms, heart screenings, and more. To help patients get back in the routine of preventative screenings and care, healthcare organizations need to reach out to their patients, share healthcare campaign information, sign patients up for classes or screenings, and promote additional services that help improve patients&rsquo; overall health and well-being. Use a series of texts, emails, <em>and</em> phone calls to make sure patients know that you offer both telehealth and in-person appointments for services they may have missed. <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/beyond_a_healthcare_call_center/">Healthcare call centers</a> can help schedule patients either right into the EHR or by working directly with your office staff. Clients who have conducted outbound scheduling campaigns see as high as a 20% conversion rate of patients called to appointments booked.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p><a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/covid-19-main-telehealth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BEST PRACTICE: Have an outbound call strategy, not just direct mail or ads, that targets at-risk patients and those who delayed preventative care appointments because of COVID-19.</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="blog-subhead">Healthcare Call Centers Provide Broad Patient Support</h2><p>Healthcare call center outsourcing can improve patient satisfaction and patient engagement while simultaneously helping to increase patient access and revenue.

							<p><em>Christopher Rogers is the COO at&nbsp;</em><a class="color-link" title="https://carenethealthcare.com/" href="https://carenethealthcare.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://carenethealthcare.com/" aria-label="Carenet Health"><em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://carenethealthcare.com/">Carenet Health</em></a><em>&nbsp;and has over 20 years of consumer and client engagement experience.</em></p><p>Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, has been a part of the technological landscape for many years. Sentiment analysis leverages natural language processing to evaluate written or spoken language to determine if an emotional tone being expressed is favorable, unfavorable or neutral. By utilizing machine learning, neural networks and other types of artificial intelligence (AI) along with computational linguistics, sentiment analysis can yield insight on how a consumer felt about their customer support experience.</p><p>Recently, there&rsquo;s been a notable surge in the advancement and growth of sentiment analysis, driven by its utilization of large language models and the ongoing refinement of AI technology. In healthcare, for example, there are a range of potential opportunities to&nbsp;<a class="color-link" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10298432/" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10298432/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10298432/" aria-label="elevate the quality of the patient experience">elevate the quality of the patient experience</a>&nbsp;and the care they receive through the application of sentiment analysis.</p><p>As it evolves and becomes more sophisticated, sentiment analysis platforms can accurately and efficiently gauge a patient&rsquo;s emotional state and thereby facilitate communication between providers and patients that is more concise and effective. Accordingly, AI-driven emotional recognition tools in healthcare represent an ethically sound application of a technology that can drive better treatment decisions and improve health outcomes.</p><h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">Leveraging The Value Of Emotional Recognition AI</h2><p>In the context of virtual care, especially in settings that don&rsquo;t include video interaction such as phone-based conversations between individuals, clinicians and support staff, leveraging emotional recognition AI could be highly valuable. Without the benefit of nonverbal cues, AI can serve as a supportive cobot by assisting with or conducting repetitive tasks and gauging caller emotions to help inform which processes are working and identifying how improvements could be made in future interactions.</p><p>By applying sentiment analysis in this way, healthcare professionals can be presented with clear instructions and tips on how to best adapt their approach in order to optimize how they convey medical advice and deliver care to each individual patient. When leveraged as a training tool with the goal of increasing patient satisfaction and decreasing friction, sentiment analysis can help guide healthcare professionals in effectively navigating virtual engagements based on displayed emotions, comments and symptoms.</p><p>Sentiment analysis can identify why an individual was satisfied with the support they received or how they were treated and what is needed to automate and improve future interactions. As a result, people feel that they&rsquo;re being listened to and cared for, which in turn fosters loyalty and trust.</p><p>To provide basic insights into the emotions expressed or detected during support calls, sentiment analysis that doesn&rsquo;t entail advanced AI-emotion detection is a relatively common component of customer service support centers. Cobots in use today can actively listen to calls and offer recommendations to call center agents for improved outcomes based on learned next steps. When it eventually enters the mainstream, the fusion of these elements to achieve a more profound real-time emotion recognition represents an exciting stage in the evolution of sentiment analysis.</p><p>However, the adoption of this technology in healthcare is likely not imminent. It&rsquo;s almost certain that retail call center agents will incorporate emotional AI cobots before healthcare professionals utilizing virtual care will fully integrate this technology into their workflows. While diagnostic and treatment technologies in healthcare often stand at the forefront of innovation, the implementation of technology for&nbsp;<a class="color-link" title="https://www.practicebuilders.com/blog/sentiment-analysis-in-healthcare/" href="https://www.practicebuilders.com/blog/sentiment-analysis-in-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.practicebuilders.com/blog/sentiment-analysis-in-healthcare/" aria-label="enhancing the patient experience">enhancing the patient experience</a>&nbsp;and communication typically lags behind consumer engagement efforts.</p><h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align">The Sensitivity Of Health Data Calls For Safeguards And Regulation</h2><p>While the ongoing consumerization of healthcare will continue to challenge the industry&rsquo;s typically slower response than retail&rsquo;s foray into technology, it&rsquo;s important to consider the sensitivity surrounding personal health data and health-related conversations that call for strict safeguards.</p><p>Despite what the future of AI technology holds, the increasingly rapid pace of AI-driven change has, in a sense, caught the world off guard. As evidenced by the Biden administration&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="color-link" title="https://apnews.com/article/biden-ai-artificial-intelligence-executive-order-cb86162000d894f238f28ac029005059" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-ai-artificial-intelligence-executive-order-cb86162000d894f238f28ac029005059" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://apnews.com/article/biden-ai-artificial-intelligence-executive-order-cb86162000d894f238f28ac029005059" aria-label="recent executive order">recent executive order</a>, governments are taking notice that cutting-edge tech needs to be balanced against national security and consumers&rsquo; rights.</p><p>Although governments at all levels aren&rsquo;t known for the haste with which they operate, regulation is essential for AI as a whole, and safeguards will need to be developed quickly given the rapidly evolving nature of this technology. Regulation with a special emphasis on generative large language model AI will be critical as existing constraints on generative AI are primarily human-generated. Technologies that unsettle even the most informed experts and business leaders due to their potential require regulation. This will ensure that such tools don&rsquo;t lead to adverse outcomes, propagate harmful intentions or generate responses based on self-learned information, rendering the tool either ineffective or risky.</p><p>Nevertheless, by recognizing the risks involved and taking steps to guard against how the technology is used, sentiment analysis can play a critical role in enhancing the patient experience. As healthcare strives to keep pace technologically with industries like retail and finance, it will be compelling to gauge the evolution of sentiment analysis and its potential to foster more meaningful connections between patients and providers.</p>

							<p>This past year showed us healthcare consumers have more care options than ever before. However, we have learned not all options are the most convenient, appropriate, or cost-effective for every individual. Additionally, hospitals and health systems are dealing with overcrowding and high-volume patient loads following spikes of COVID-19, the flu, and RSV. With a close pulse on industry trends and supporting one-third of Americans through their health plan, provider, or pharmacy, Carenet Health experts identified areas across the system that will improve the business of healthcare by optimizing revenues, improving care access, and streamlining the patient and member experience. Our leaders share how to route healthcare consumers to the best-fit care option, utilize technology in an empathetic and meaningful way, and simultaneously strengthen revenue and deliver better health outcomes.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p>Staffing shortages and inefficiencies, spikes in infectious disease, labor strikes, natural disasters, and the aging U.S. population will perpetuate the healthcare workforce crisis through 2024 and beyond.</p></blockquote><p>Here are the top predictions for healthcare trends to better prepare payers and providers in 2024:</p><h2 class="blog-subhead">Creativity and outsourcing are the solutions to the healthcare labor crisis</h2><p>Staffing shortages and inefficiencies, spikes in infectious disease, labor strikes, natural disasters, and the aging U.S. population will perpetuate the healthcare workforce crisis through 2024 and beyond. When discussing burnout and shortages in healthcare, the focus is often too narrow. Nurses and physicians are not the only ones at risk. The entire hospital staff &mdash; administrative and other jobs included &mdash; need their leaders to adopt innovative technology and adjust workflows and workloads to maximize their job efficiency and satisfaction. The crisis requires payers and providers to <strong>implement innovative staffing solutions</strong> and outsource healthcare call center needs to a business process outsourcing (BPO) organization to mitigate the labor crisis&rsquo;s impact on patient care, ease the strain on the workforce, and save time and money.</p><p>Adopting recruitment or retention strategies can ease the cost and pessimism associated with labor shortages. A <a href="https://www.kaufmanhall.com/insights/research-report/2023-state-healthcare-performance-improvement-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report from Kaufman Hall</a> found that health systems that implemented at least one recruitment or retention strategy such as raising salaries (98%), introducing signing bonuses (84%), and increasing opportunities for remote, or hybrid work schedules (76%) reduced labor costs. Scaling back the use of contract labor, leveraging automation, changing care delivery models, and outsourcing responsibilities were also associated with reduced labor costs.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28771 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ForecastBlog_80.png" alt="80% of surveyed healthcare executives have made significant investments into technology to combat nursing and physician burnout" width="700" height="306"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to Bain&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/2023-healthcare-provider-it-report-doubling-down-on-innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 Healthcare Provider IT Report</a>, 80% of healthcare executives surveyed reported a sizable increase in IT and software investment to confront their most pressing challenges, including burnout. This type of strategic investment has the power to change healthcare labor and consumer experiences in 2024.</p><p>Nursing staff turnover, accelerated by unaddressed burnout, poses a serious threat to provider organization revenues. An <a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/rn-turnover-healthcare-rise#:~:text=WHAT'S%20THE%20IMPACT%3F,%245.2%20million%20and%20%249%20million." target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSI National Health Care Retention &amp; RN Staffing Report</a> found that the average cost of turnover for a bedside registered nurse is $46,100, resulting in the average hospital losing between $5.2 million and $9 million. <a href="https://mhealthintelligence.com/news/hybrid-nursing-model-expands-following-successful-pilot">Hybrid nursing</a> (or &ldquo;co-caring&rdquo;) models &ndash; which entail staffing structures that incorporate remote-first clinicians to supplement in-clinic staff &ndash; is one creative solution that will grow in 2024 to address this challenge. To reduce the burden on nurses and support medical teams, hybrid nursing uses technology to help virtual nurses assist bedside teams through a bi-directional audio and video platform. These nurses can help monitor patients and handle processes related to admissions, discharge preparation, the creation of checklists prior to a procedure, and more. While there is little interest in a fully remote care experience among patients, 56% of respondents to Carenet&rsquo;s <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/2022-us-consumer-healthcare-trends-survey/">U.S. Consumer Trends in Patient Engagement Survey</a> said they are open to telehealth visits for some providers, and <a href="https://6898184.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/6898184/2023%20Content%20Files/Carenet%20Health%20-%202023%20Survey%20-%20Health%20Insurance%20Member%20Experience.pdf?__hstc=239813340.0f45b86ea9c02e7783449a88d6b34066.1699988940106.1701257175075.1701262779424.6&amp;__hssc=239813340.5.1701262779424&amp;__hsfp=4253508547&amp;hsCtaTracking=83c30235-03a8-4b42-93ec-250da6039824%7C7c70e437-6a75-4abf-b8b4-7bda977f7b25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a growing number</a> of members seek advice from their health plan through nurse advice lines, further diverting care from in-person clinics to remote care alternatives.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p>56% of respondents to Carenet&rsquo;s U.S. Consumer Trends in Patient Engagement Survey said they are open to telehealth visits for some providers, and a growing number of members seek advice from their health plan through nurse advice lines.</p></blockquote><p>In an interview on adopting solutions that benefit both patients and clinicians at the 2023 HLTH conference, Carenet&rsquo;s Patches Seely, MBA, BSN, RN, and EVP of Clinical Solutions, told <a href="https://swaay.health/2023/11/13/creating-solutions-that-benefit-both-patients-and-clinicians/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Swaay.Health</em></a> editor and founder John Lynn, &ldquo;We tend to focus on the physician and the nurse &ndash; both are critically important roles &ndash; but every one of us can speak to the myriad of clinicians that make up part of our care teams. We have to increase our inclusivity of which clinicians we choose because we&rsquo;re going to have to get really creative with the members of a care team. Nursing is in shortage. Physicians are struggling with burnout and challenges, so we really must get creative about the human capital and how we&rsquo;re engaging talent around an individual.&rdquo;</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p>&ldquo;We tend to focus on the physician and the nurse &ndash; both are critically important roles &ndash; but every one of us can speak to the myriad of clinicians that make up part of our care teams.

There is an imminent need to use AI to streamline processes and administrative workload to alleviate the labor crisis. In healthcare, the arrival of AI will accelerate developments in interactive and customized patient experiences, streamlined administrative tasks and provider workflows, and improved access to healthcare.</p><p>The use of AI to assist in documenting patient information will continue to grow in 2024. The industry can expect improved natural language processing (NLP) models that <strong>streamline the documentation process, improve accuracy, and reduce administrative burden on clinicians </strong>so they can spend more of their time caring for patients. Furthermore, AI&rsquo;s role in aiding clinicians in the interpretation of medical scans will advance with the refinement of deep learning algorithms that can identify subtle abnormalities in images to provide more accurate diagnoses and enhance patient care. These technologies will not only excel at singular tasks but will also evolve to become increasingly versatile and capable of supporting complex decision-making.</p><p>However, there is still work to be done. As healthcare costs continue to rise and revenue margins tighten, providers and payers will face increasing pressures to develop cost-effective strategies and <strong>invest in leading-edge technologies such as AI and machine learning to streamline processes and cut costs.</strong> Some AI tools aren&rsquo;t yet equipped to source from up-to-date and relevant materials, require human editors to double-check the results, and still need to be optimized to recognize and appropriately address healthcare consumers&rsquo; emotions. As these are still emerging technologies, it is imperative to understand potential risks and safeguard compliance, including HIPAA, to ensure unauthorized use of patient data does not occur. Christopher Rogers, Chief Operating Officer at Carenet, told <a href="https://medcitynews.com/2023/05/chatgpt-in-healthcare-the-promise-and-the-danger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>MedCity News,</em></a> &ldquo;The security of AI-generated data is also a concern as technologies like ChatGPT require vast amounts of data to inform and drive their language processing capabilities. The effort to safeguard data breaches involving personal information and electronic health records (EHRs) will require vigilance.&rdquo; He continued to explain the risk of using generative AI to self-medicate, which can result in a misdiagnosis. &ldquo;The sweet spot for those seeking healthcare-related information is to view AI as a helpful tool to use in combination with seeking care from medical professionals. In some ways, AI-generated information can be considered akin to obtaining a second or even third opinion regarding one&rsquo;s health &ndash; it makes up part of what needs to be known, but it&rsquo;s not the entire story.&rdquo;</p><p>Ultimately, AI should be a tool that enables more empathetic, human experiences. To digitize healthcare and lean on emerging technologies, it&rsquo;s imperative to identify the opportunity within the relationship between machine and human to provide the compassionate touch in care. In an op-ed in <a href="https://medcitynews.com/2023/11/digitizing-healthcare-can-ai-augment-empathy-and-compassion-in-healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>MedCity News,</em></a> Patches Seely highlighted AI&rsquo;s ultimate potential for the future: &ldquo;There is an inherent opportunity that emerges for AI to be used to help physicians provide better, compassionate, and empathetic care. Whether we use AI in training or to help free up time and space for healthcare workers to provide better care, we need to continue exploring effective AI use across the care continuum to help every member&mdash; patient and provider included.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="blog-subhead">Payers and providers must get competitive with consumerism or lose financially</h2><p>Increased healthcare competition and access to information, the rise of virtual care, and the demand for more personalized healthcare experiences are driving consumerism in healthcare more than ever. Those that choose not to provide the essential amenities that healthcare consumers expect&mdash;such as online self-scheduling and appointment reminders&mdash; will not survive the increase in industry competition. As Christopher Rogers told <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/05/17/prioritizing-online-patient-scheduling-is-imperative-in-todays-retail-world/?sh=3484cd426f49" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Forbes,</em></a> &ldquo;As competition from major retailers and big tech companies continues to infiltrate the [healthcare] marketplace, online patient scheduling options are now a must-have feature for hospitals and health systems. The health systems that do not offer online patient scheduling will not only be left behind but will be left out, especially as patients are becoming more reliant on digital sources when selecting their providers.&rdquo;</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28772 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ForecastBlog_82.png" alt="82% of respondents between 18-34 years old have stayed with the same practice or primary care physician for routine care" width="700" height="306"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The era of seeing the same provider for decades is over, as patients value convenience over loyalty to a single provider. Offering convenience and self-scheduling is critical to retaining patients&mdash;especially patients of the younger generation. In Carenet&rsquo;s <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/2022-us-consumer-healthcare-trends-survey">U.S. Consumer Survey</a>, 95% of respondents aged 55 and over reported they had stayed with the same practice or primary care physician for routine care. Among 18- to 34-year-olds, that number dropped to 82%, showing that younger adults are less loyal to their providers and more likely to consider alternatives. Patients seek convenience and do not want to wait to obtain care; if care isn&rsquo;t easily available through one provider, they will find it elsewhere.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28773 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ForecastBlog_95.png" alt="95% of respondents 55 and older stayed with the same practice or primary care physician for routine care" width="700" height="306"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Convenient self-scheduling options are only one piece of the puzzle. To stay relevant and stand out, healthcare providers must build trust with patient-consumers and provide accessible and personalized healthcare experiences. This draws in new patients and helps existing patients feel cared for (i.e. an empathetic provider-patient interaction). &ldquo;An excellent healthcare provider is someone who is invested in you and your health and wellbeing,&rdquo; said Carenet CEO John Erwin in <a href="https://medium.com/authority-magazine/john-erwin-of-carenet-health-on-5-things-we-need-to-do-to-improve-the-us-healthcare-system-13586550b77a" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Authority Magazine.</em></a></p><p>Building a broader web of healthcare support around patients tailored to the individual&rsquo;s needs is paramount for both the patient experience and hospitals&rsquo; and health systems&rsquo; revenues. Not only does this customized approach increase consumer loyalty and ensure faster, better care for patients, it helps steer patients toward in-network care that keeps revenue within the system. As of 2023, 55% to 65% of referrals were being sent to out-of-network providers, adding up to nearly <a href="https://medcitynews.com/2023/01/25-shocking-statistics-that-keep-healthcare-executives-up-at-night" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 million per physician.</a> With <a href="https://medcitynews.com/2023/01/25-shocking-statistics-that-keep-healthcare-executives-up-at-night" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10% to 30% of a hospital&rsquo;s revenue</a> on the line due to patient leakage, embracing consumerization is no longer negotiable.</p><p>Additionally, with the transition to value-based care, engaging patients and tailoring care is critical to promoting better health outcomes to achieve maximum reimbursement. Value-based care adoption has grown substantially over the past decade, and growth in this area may be on track to reach <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/investing-in-the-new-era-of-value-based-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 trillion in enterprise value</a> for payers, providers, and investors. This transition from fee-for-service to value-based care further incentivizes payers and providers to engage patients and members and direct them to timely, preventative, and routine care. In order to do so, payers and providers must streamline and optimize the consumer experience.</p><p>Another incentive to embrace consumerism in healthcare is the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services&rsquo; (CMS) Star Rating system. This system has updated its rankings and now rates health plans on a myriad of variables including member experience, beneficiary health, customer service performance, member complaints, and member chronic condition management.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-28774 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ForecastBlog_Bullets.png" alt="to keep patient consumers attention and loyalty healthcare providers must offer convenient and personalized healthcare experiences and flexible and multi -language scheduling options and alternative care opportunities and accessible online tools and apps for effectivbe care management" width="700" height="306"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Health plans must leverage technology and multi-channel approaches to engage members and improve their experience. According to Carenet&rsquo;s <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/report-validates-insurance-members-improved-experiences-demand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 Healthcare Consumer Insights Report: Understanding the Health Insurance Member Experience</a>, the majority of surveyed members said using technology to manage their health is important. The monetary benefits for health plans and providers are self-evident as well. <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/insights-into-improving-health-care-member-satisfaction">One large Medicare Advantage plan</a> utilizing a member engagement approach increased its revenue by $700 million. Payers and their provider counterparts are leaving a goldmine of revenue, reimbursement, and positive patient/member sentiment on the table if they don&rsquo;t embrace technology-enabled, convenient, and meaningful care.</p><h2 class="blog-subhead">Increased need to unlock new levels of access, education, and health equity</h2><p>Although the use of technology has a myriad of benefits, payers and providers still need to educate consumers on what to look for when booking appointments, finding specialists, or negotiating medical bills to ensure optimal patient-member engagement and retention. While technology has brought care into the consumer&rsquo;s home and tackled accessibility, affordability is a key deciding factor for most consumers when choosing to delay or pursue care. As Vikie Spulak, Executive Vice President, Strategic Accounts at Carenet explains in <a href="https://www.healthcareittoday.com/2023/05/05/how-technology-can-help-us-achieve-health-equity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Healthcare IT Today,</em></a> &ldquo;It is imperative to focus on diverse populations, including those on Medicaid receiving necessary treatment, and especially those that lack access to the internet or new technologies.&rdquo;</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p>&ldquo;It is imperative to focus on diverse populations, including those on Medicaid receiving necessary treatment, and especially those that lack access to the internet or new technologies.&rdquo; &ndash; Vikie Spulak, Executive Vice President, Strategic Accounts at Carenet</p></blockquote><p>For instance, language barriers have a profound limiting factor on positive health outcomes. They can lead to miscommunication between patients and medical professionals, reduce patient satisfaction, and have adverse effects on healthcare quality and patient safety. Skip Hanson, Executive Vice President of Service Delivery, explained to <a href="https://www.healthdatamanagement.com/articles/why-breaking-language-barriers-is-key-to-achieving-health-equity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Health Data Management,</em></a> &ldquo;Embracing technology and innovation can further enhance language access, making healthcare more inclusive and equitable. By leveraging multilingual telehealth, engagement, and clinical support and advocacy solutions, organizations can drive patient access and adherence, empowering healthcare consumers to seek preventative care and take more control of their health.&rdquo;</p><p>Additionally, payers and providers must anticipate consumer preferences and behavior by letting consumer data lead the way. Nontraditional, user-friendly entrants like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/saibala/2023/11/08/amazon-announces-new-benefit-for-prime-members-primary-care-services-for-9-per-month/?sh=25eb005e7aca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a> (i.e. primary care services for $9 per month) are already experts at leveraging consumer data for an economically, racially, and behaviorally diverse American population. They know how to anticipate spikes in healthcare demand, leverage digital front doors that aggregate consumers&rsquo; health history in one place, and personalize their offerings to consumer preferences and needs.</p><p>Expanding accessibility translates to patient and member revenue potential &ndash; something big tech and retail are keenly aware of and are ready to capitalize on, especially if traditional healthcare institutions are too slow on the draw.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p>&ldquo;Providers that can excel at understanding today&rsquo;s healthcare consumers, solving their pain points and offering choice, convenience, and control will be more competitive and positioned for growth in the new age of healthcare.&rdquo; &ndash; Rhonda Gibler, Chief Sales Officer, Carenet</p></blockquote><p>What should providers and health plans glean from this? <strong>Adapt or get left behind.</strong> Some institutions are embracing this need, as many have adopted tools to overcome language barriers, created satellite clinics, and implemented virtual health appointments, nurse advice lines, and intelligent scheduling. Carenet Chief Sales Officer Rhonda Gibler explained in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2023/11/22/healthcares-evolution-the-rise-of-the-empowered-patient-consumer/?sh=3ccf52c97545" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Forbes,</em></a> &ldquo;Providers that can excel at understanding today&rsquo;s healthcare consumers, solving their pain points and offering choice, convenience, and control will be more competitive and positioned for growth in the new age of healthcare.&rdquo;</p><p>Heading into 2024, providers and payers should take a page from retail&rsquo;s playbook by getting smarter about the utilization of consumer data to cut costs and streamline the patient experience for individuals no matter their background or circumstances.</p><h2 class="blog-subhead">A path forward in 2024</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic volatility accentuated many shortcomings in the U.S. healthcare system. Even so, the challenges of the pandemic prompted positive changes that will continue to crystallize into 2024. In-person primary care visits may become superfluous or applicable only in rare cases due to virtual care. Health tech innovations like virtual visits, remote patient monitoring, and digital-front door consumer engagement platforms will increasingly allow and empower individuals to manage their health on their terms.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p>AI has the potential to fill in certain gaps in healthcare, too. As hospitals continue to adopt new technology, it can decrease the burden on physicians and healthcare staff. Freeing up time for patient care to focus on better health outcomes is crucial for health systems&rsquo; revenue.</p></blockquote><p>Additionally, the labor shortage continues to be one of the largest issues currently facing the healthcare industry. There are a few ways to help ensure that staff are operating efficiently and cut costs: automate when possible, give patients and members the option of self-service to manage care on their own, and implement live-phone or virtual interactions (often the fastest way for a consumer to seek a resolution to a problem, and the most efficient option for physicians and nurses). Of note, AI has the potential to fill in certain gaps in healthcare, too. As hospitals continue to adopt new technology, it can decrease the burden on physicians and healthcare staff. Freeing up time for patient care to focus on better health outcomes is crucial for health systems&rsquo; revenue.</p><p>In the new year, obtaining cost-effective solutions that drive member and patient engagement, improve workforce management, and support virtual care systems will be nonnegotiable. Simplifying and modernizing the patient and member experience should be at the forefront. To keep patient-consumers&rsquo; attention and loyalty, healthcare providers must deliver convenient and personalized healthcare experiences, including flexible multi-language scheduling, alternative care options, and online tools and apps. To motivate members to stay healthy and seek preventative care, rather than reactive and costly care, payers must engage members early and often. Stakeholders in both groups that fail to adapt will continue to see poor outcomes, loyalty, and retention&mdash;a critical concern to any institution given the economic uncertainty we face in 2024.</p><p>But how can hospitals and health systems manage these hefty tasks? By implementing a strategic partnership with a BPO. A healthcare-focused BPO understands the complexities of healthcare. They have the tools to solve challenges across the spectrum and are a key resource to building scalable processes that support the business of health plans, hospitals and health systems. The pandemic taught us that we need to be ready, and if health systems and health plans don&rsquo;t have a trusted partner that is actively integrated within an organization and is well versed in its strategies, the system will be caught off guard. The organization&rsquo;s bottom line and patients/members will inevitably reap the benefits of a partnership with a BPO.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p>&ldquo;If there is one thing I could change, it would encompass empowering and energizing the healthcare consumer.

In a perfect world, I would accelerate this trend, so patients [and members] would feel qualified and informed enough to understand their healthcare choices and options.&rdquo; &ndash; John Erwin, Chief Executive Officer at Carenet</p></blockquote><p>Those benefits are manifold with engagement and support being chief among them. Erwin noted in <a href="https://medium.com/authority-magazine/john-erwin-of-carenet-health-on-5-things-we-need-to-do-to-improve-the-us-healthcare-system-13586550b77a" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Authority Magazine,</em></a> &ldquo;If there is one thing I could change, it would encompass empowering and energizing the healthcare consumer.

Health disparities prevent individuals from accessing quality healthcare, create barriers to healthy lifestyles and impact a patient&rsquo;s ability to effectively manage their care and get the treatment they need.

Even as leaders and their teams work to find new and innovative ways to improve health equity, factors such as language barriers, high healthcare costs and poor health literacy continue to prevent patients from receiving the best care possible. By defining and communicating a vision and mission that prioritizes health equity as an organization&rsquo;s core value, you can help pave the way to improve patients&rsquo; journeys and drive better health outcomes.</p><h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"><strong>The Convergence Of Human And Digital Support</strong></h2><p>In separate reports that my company published in 2022 and 2023, surveyed patients and health plan members indicated that they prefer a balanced combination of human and digital interactions when managing their healthcare.

When interacting with providers and payers, patients and plan members want their questions and issues resolved in real time by real people&mdash;they want someone to listen to them with empathy, and they want to feel cared for.</p>&nbsp;<p>In addition to the importance of the human touch, consider delivering easy-to-use multilingual apps and online solutions to help your users find in-network providers or specialists in their area, review and pay bills and obtain test results. These easy-to-access digital resources combined with well-trained live-voice support centers are all useful resources for effectively serving diverse populations.</p><h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"><strong>Equity Begins In The Workplace</strong></h2><p>The focus on better patient experiences and improved outcomes through health equity begins at home, as organizations need to incorporate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace at every level. According to McKinsey, corporate and institutional investments in DEI are expected to&nbsp;<a class="color-link" title="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-lighthouses-2023" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-lighthouses-2023" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-lighthouses-2023" aria-label="more than double to over $15 billion by 2026">more than double to over $15 billion by 2026</a>.</p>&nbsp;<p>In its report, McKinsey identified success factors across DEI initiatives that yielded the most significant, quantifiable, and sustained impact for underrepresented groups. These success factors included offering all employees free educational and upskilling opportunities, reducing salary gaps within an organization and accelerating gender parity at the management and executive levels. These are just a few of the steps you can take within your company to ensure that your workforce is as diverse as the consumer populations you serve.</p><h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"><strong>Using Data Collection And Analytics To Address Inequities</strong></h2><p>Another equally critical driver of health equity is the role of data collection and analysis to identify where improvements in the consumer experience can be made. By engaging populations impacted by health inequities and by assessing factors such as race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status, health equity analytics can inform your decision-making as well as guide and refine organizational strategies to increase equities. Analyzing overall health outcomes and how health varies demographically across patient populations can enable your organization to better assess and address factors that fuel health inequities.</p><p>Research has shown that a major hindrance to health equity is the challenge of making quality care available to those living in medical deserts.

This may include investing in facilities that serve regions with limited healthcare resources, as well as providing accessible apps, online resources, and call center solutions such as telehealth services and nurse advice lines.</p><p>By committing to the advancement of health equity and taking action to reduce or eliminate disparities, leaders have the opportunity to make themselves and their organizations agents of change for those who need it the most.</p>

Although telehealth solutions have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9035352/">continued to proliferate</a> in healthcare since that time, the initial rush to support virtual visits during the pandemic led many health systems and providers to deploy it in a largely ad hoc manner. Post-pandemic, <a href="https://www.mddionline.com/digital-health/survey-suggests-patients-expect-telehealth-patient-portal-offerings">many patients show a preference</a> towards providers that offer telehealth and patient portals.

Coupled with in-person visits, telehealth solutions for appointments such as <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/addressing-the-void-telehealth-steps-up-for-chronic-disease-patients/">chronic care</a> check-ins, post-discharge surgery follow-up, or first-time patient appointments, hybrid care models can boost clinical staff productivity and improve the overall patient experience.</p><p>Carenet can work with health systems and every type of provider to ensure a seamless integration with platforms like Zoom or WebEx, making it possible for patients to simply click a link to start their appointment. By removing friction from the process for both patients and providers, Carenet delivers telehealth solutions that are an integral part of an existing system and not a separate or add-on remedy.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p>54% of patient engagement survey respondents said they would use a provider&rsquo;s online scheduling tool if the experience of using it was easier</p></blockquote><h2 class="blog-subhead">Carenet&rsquo;s Industry Research Identifies Consumer Telehealth Trends</h2><p>Carenet is uniquely suited to leverage its expertise on the impact that hybrid healthcare models have on patients, providers, payers, and the industry as a whole.

							<p>Today&rsquo;s healthcare consumers want convenience and personalization. Carenet&rsquo;s <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/2022-us-consumer-healthcare-trends-survey">consumer surveys</a> have revealed that patients show a strong and consistent preference for scheduling healthcare appointments online.</p><h5>Patient self-scheduling should be a fundamental component of every healthcare provider&rsquo;s approach.</h5><p>Healthcare providers that offer online scheduling and other conveniences such as flexible appointment options and streamlined registration processes will see improved patient satisfaction and retention. Those who don&rsquo;t will struggle to stay afloat in today&rsquo;s competitive healthcare arena.</p><h5>Online Scheduling Benefits</h5><p>Patient self-scheduling/online scheduling allows patients to book their own medical appointments through a digital platform like a website or app, eliminating the need to call or visit the provider just to schedule an appointment. For patients, self-scheduling increases the convenience and accessibility of care, and empowers them to take ownership of their health.</p><p><img class="wp-image-27804 size-full aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Carenet_SelfScheduling_BlogGraphics-1.png" alt="online scheduling can help providers improve patient loyalty and engagement" width="800" height="200"></p><p>Self-scheduling gives providers a competitive edge over those who have more outdated systems. It also improves efficiency and reduces the administrative burden on healthcare workers, driving cost savings.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27805 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Carenet_SelfScheduling_BlogGraphics-2.png" alt="for patients self-scheduling increases convenience and improves accessibility of cae and empowers them to gain control over their health" width="800" height="300"></p><p>Carenet&rsquo;s <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-intelligent-scheduling-solution">Intelligent Scheduling</a> has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/05/17/prioritizing-online-patient-scheduling-is-imperative-in-todays-retail-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many benefits for healthcare providers:</a></p><ul><li><strong>Improved Efficiency:</strong> Online scheduling streamlines appointment scheduling processes and reduces administrative burdens.</li><li><strong>Reduced No-Shows:</strong> Self-scheduling can help reduce appointment no-show rates.</li><li><strong>Patient Satisfaction:</strong> Online scheduling&rsquo;s ease and convenience leads to more satisfied and loyal patients.</li><li><strong>Competitive Edge: </strong>Offering patient self-scheduling sets providers apart from others.

Data security and patient privacy issues and lack of integration with existing EHRs and tech infrastructure don&rsquo;t have to be barriers to a successful transition to online appointment scheduling. The right vendor partnership is essential.</p><p>Healthcare providers should <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/healthcare-appointment-scheduling-what-to-look-for-when-you-outsource/">strategically evaluate their options</a> and implement an effective, established patient scheduling system with a vendor that can help them navigate the challenges of implementation.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27808 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Carenet_SelfScheduling_BlogGraphics-4.png" alt="best practices for self-scheduling include communication strategies patient education and staff training" width="800" height="300"></p><p>No matter the patient scheduling platform or vendor, here are three best practices for self-scheduling:</p><ul><li><strong>Communication Strategies:</strong> To effectively inform patients about self-scheduling options, providers should use multiple channels, including email, social media, texts, and print materials. <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/best-practices-in-patient-scheduling-for-healthcare-marketers/">Visit our blog</a> for more information on best practices in patient self-scheduling for healthcare marketers.</li><li><strong>Patient Education:</strong> In addition to making patients aware of self-scheduling options, providers must educate patients on how to use these tools. Some patients may require extra support with steps such as confirming the appointment, completely any pre-appointment paperwork, and entering billing information online.</li><li><strong>Staff Training</strong>: Patient self-scheduling can greatly reduce the administrative burden on staff. However, in order for self-scheduling to increase efficiency, staff must be properly trained. This also enables staff to better answer patient questions about the scheduling system, further improving the patient experience.</li></ul><h5>Carenet&rsquo;s Scheduling Solution Increases Patient Satisfaction</h5><p>St. Luke&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s Center needed a patient scheduling solution to manage its multiple mammography sites, growing patient population, and high inbound call volume. They implemented Carenet&rsquo;s <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-intelligent-scheduling-solution">Intelligent Scheduling</a>, which provided patients with a way to schedule mammography screenings that was convenient and available 24/7.</p><p>Carenet&rsquo;s Intelligent Scheduling <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/online-appointment-scheduling-boosts-patient-acquisition">helped St. Luke&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s Center</a> attract new patients, retain existing ones, and reduce staff burden &mdash; improving access to mammography screenings with the convenience and ease of online scheduling.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27809 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Carenet_SelfScheduling_BlogGraphics-5.png" alt="97% of st lukes women's health patients said they would recommend online scheduling" width="800" height="380"></p><h5>The Future of Patient Self-Scheduling</h5><p>At Carenet Health, we anticipate that patient self-scheduling will continue to be a <a href="https://www.physiciansweekly.com/patient-self-scheduling-is-a-necessity/">necessity</a> at hospitals and health systems.</p><p>As adoption of online patient scheduling systems increases, AI and telehealth integration will be used to enhance scheduling processes and improve the overall patient experience.&nbsp;Healthcare providers that wish to stay competitive must take steps now to adapt to new patient expectations by implementing online scheduling through a well-established vendor.</p><p>To learn more about how to improve the patient experience with online scheduling, download our <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-intelligent-scheduling-guide">Patient Intelligent Scheduling Guide.</a></p>

							<h4>Best Practices in Maximizing Mammography Screening Rates</h4><p>&ndash; Adam Donaldson, MHA, BS(MIS), RT(R)(ARRT) &ndash;</p><p>Annual mammography screenings are critical to the health of women and are recommended for all women starting at age 40.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.acraccreditation.org/mammography-saves-lives">American College of Radiology</a> estimates that mammograms have helped reduce breast cancer mortality in the U.S. by nearly 40% since 1990 and <a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.25650">similar studies</a> by have reconfirmed that regular mammography screening cuts breast cancer deaths by roughly a third in all women ages 40 and over, including women ages 40-49.&nbsp; In fact, mammography is the only test shown to reduce breast cancer deaths, and detecting breast cancer early when it&rsquo;s most treatable improves survival rates.</p><p>Carenet Health has developed industry best practices for maximizing annual mammography screening rates. Hospitals, Imaging Centers, Women&rsquo;s Health Clinics, and Mammography Centers can hope to see an increase of breast cancer screening rates of up to 50% by utilizing these industry best practices in connection with <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-intelligent-scheduling-solution">medical appointment scheduling.</a></p><h5>Mammography Screening Best Practice: Engaging and Training Primary Care and Referring Physicians with Online Self-Scheduling</h5><p>Referring physicians are the life blood to radiology practices, and primary care visits are the perfect time for providers to engage patients in discussions about their preventative health options including screening mammograms.&nbsp; Moreover, when it comes to ease of access into your organization, there is no better option than <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-intelligent-scheduling-solution">online self-scheduling</a>.</p><p>When imaging centers are armed with online self-scheduling, Carenet Health has witnessed those clinics with the highest patient volume have spent time with their referring clinics, discussing their online self-scheduling capabilities, educating referring providers about how easy it is for their patients to self-schedule screenings.</p><p>These conversations have included the following tips and advice:</p><ul><li>The link to their online schedule can be easily bookmarked on a clinic tablet and given to a patient to use</li><li>Posters could be hung in the examination rooms complete with a QR code that when scanned, quickly and easily pulls up the online screening mammography schedule on the patient&rsquo;s smartphone.</li><li>Staff can be taught to encourage self-scheduling when checking patients in or out of their screening appointments</li></ul><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p>If you use online self-scheduling, meeting with your referring providers and educating them on your patient self-scheduling success, providing them with resources they can offer to their patients that make it quick and easy to find and schedule care, is time well spent.</p></blockquote><p>If you need help with planning these discussions, your Carenet Health Account Manager will be happy to help guide you and even participate in meetings.&nbsp; If you need help generating a QR code to place on your collateral material that will hang in the examination rooms, Carenet Health can help with that as well.&nbsp; And if you are not yet a Carenet Health customer and wish to be able to offer referring physicians a quick and easy way for their patients to access your screening mammography schedule, please contact a Carenet Health Strategic Sales Executive who will assist you in maximizing your mammography screening rates.</p><h5>Mammography Screening Best Practice: Maximize Rates with a Multi-Tiered Approach to Patient Reminders</h5><p>The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine published an original research article in titled <a href="https://www.jabfm.org/content/28/1/46" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&ldquo;Improving Breast and Colon Cancer Screening Rates: A Comparison of Letters, Automated Phone Calls, or Both&rdquo;</a> where their aim was to understand the differential effects of low-cost automated telephone and personalized letters on cancer screening rates.</p><p>Their findings indicate that specific to mammography screening rates, utilizing&nbsp; both a letter <strong>and</strong> an automated phone call <strong>nearly&nbsp; doubled improvement over just letters alone</strong>, and 1.6x improvement over automated phone calls alone.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27961 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-practices-mamography-stat.png" alt="utilizing both a letter and an automated phone call nearly doubled mammography rates a 1.6x improvement over automated phone calls alone" width="700" height="306"></p><p>With a combination of personalized letters <strong>and</strong> automated phone calls proving to be so beneficial in improving the rate of screening mammography volume, let&rsquo;s explore each of these individually:</p><h5>Mammography Screening Best Practice: Introduce QR Codes for Online Self-Scheduling to your Reminder Letters</h5><p>Your RIS (Radiology Information System) or BIRAD system does a great job of generating patient reminder letters for their annual breast cancer screening exam, but if you are not incorporating ease of access into your facility by offering a small QR code that links to your online mammography schedule onto your reminder letter template, you are missing a great opportunity to better serve your patients.&nbsp; Utilizing technology on your reminder letters is a huge benefit to patients because it saves time and makes the scheduling process quick and seamless.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p>In 2021, 75.9% of women aged 50-74 years had a mammogram within the past two years.<br><span style="color: #333; font-size: 10px;">Source: National Cancer Institute</span></p></blockquote><p>Upon receiving their reminder letter, if patients have the ability to utilize their smart phone by scanning a QR code and accessing your screening mammography availability online, you will be rewarded with increased screening mammography rates.&nbsp; Making this edit to your RIS or BIRAD system template is a quick and easy edit that your system administrator or RIS/BIRAD system vendor can perform.&nbsp; If you need assistance in generating a QR code to incorporate into your personalized letters, your Carenet Health Account Manager can help you with generating a code that points directly to your online self-scheduling page.</p><h5>Mammography Screening Best Practice: Double Rates by Leveraging Carenet Health&rsquo;s Communications &amp; Reminders Solution</h5><p>Carenet Health&rsquo;s <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/communication-and-reminders">Communications &amp; Reminders</a> solution provides hospitals, imaging centers, women&rsquo;s health clinics and mammography centers with low cost automated patient reminder services via SMS text messaging and/or automated phone calls.&nbsp; Utilizing Communications &amp; Reminders for low cost text and phone reminders <strong>in addition</strong> to personalized letters complete with a QR code to your online scheduling availability will help you achieve results similar to the study Phillips conducted, where screening rates doubled. SMS text messages can be personalized with the patient&rsquo;s name and include a link to your online self-scheduling screening mammography page for ease of access.</p><p>If you are not currently using <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/communication-and-reminders">Communication &amp; Reminders</a> to provide low-cost SMS text or automated phone reminders to maximize your screening mammography rates, <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/contact-carenet-sales">contact Carenet</a> to get started today.</p><h5>Mammography Screening Best Practice: Talk to Patients During Their Visit About Online Self-Scheduling</h5><p>Perhaps the easiest way to maximize your breast cancer screening rates is talking with your patients.&nbsp; From the registration desk to the exam room, patients interact with a number of your staff, and each point of contact is an opportunity to educate them about online self-scheduling.&nbsp; Front desk staff can assist patients in scheduling their next annual mammogram at a nearby self-service kiosk that consistently displays a webpage pointing to your online mammography availability.&nbsp; When the exam is over, your mammographers could provide a business card with a QR code to your online mammography schedule.</p><p class="blog-cta"><a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/contact-carenet">Contact Us To Learn More About our Intelligent Scheduling and Communication &amp; Reminders Solutions.</a></p>

							Medicaid is a lifeline for more than <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/10-things-to-know-about-the-unwinding-of-the-medicaid-continuous-enrollment-provision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90 million U.S. adults and children</a>. Laws enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic removed annual renewal requirements, making it easier for people to remain covered by their Medicaid plans. This continuous enrollment period also eliminated the need for plan administrators to conduct annual Medicaid redetermination.

However, in early 2023, the continuous enrollment period for Medicaid ended. With states resuming routine Medicaid disenrollment processes, plan administrators are now scrambling to connect with beneficiaries and complete redetermination requirements.

&ldquo;Continuous enrollment ensured healthcare access for vulnerable populations, including children,&rdquo; says Shawna Knight, director of client operations and clinical services for Carenet. &ldquo;Without annual renewal requirements for the past few years, many Medicaid beneficiaries have moved or become difficult to reach. This means millions of people stand to lose coverage.&rdquo;

Knight says a loss of Medicaid coverage is about so much more than loss of health insurance.

&ldquo;When people lose Medicaid coverage,&rdquo; says Knight, &ldquo;they often lose other benefits, like transportation and access to meal programs.&rdquo;
<p class="blog-cta"><a href="#">Let Us Help With Medicaid Redetermination</a></p>
The Carenet Health team is focused on helping clients keep their Medicaid enrollees covered. And, Knight says, outreach offered by the Carenet medical call center can benefit the health and well-being of enrollees along with the financial health of payers and providers.
<h5>The Bottom Line for Medicaid Redetermination</h5>
High Medicaid turnover rates can be costly and disruptive for healthcare providers, payers and individuals. Medicaid redetermination:

<ul>
 	<li>Prevents coverage gaps: Maintaining coverage prevents healthcare access issues, which can lead to delayed or skipped medical care.</li>
 	<li>Preserves revenue: Re-enrolling Medicaid members guarantees payments for providers and associated premiums for health plans.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Carenet Can Help With Medicaid Redetermination</h5>
Carenet works with health plans and payers to conduct direct outreach and member engagement. By seeking help with redetermination, organizations can ensure eligible beneficiaries retain their coverage. Carenet offers:

<ul>
 	<li>Expertise: Our enrollment and eligibility experts understand the Medicaid redetermination process. They work with beneficiaries to ensure all necessary documentation is gathered and submitted correctly.</li>
 	<li>Compliance: Carenet experts ensure your organization stays in compliance with all relevant Medicaid rules and regulations.</li>
 	<li>Efficiency: The Carenet team helps reduce administrative burden, allowing organizations to focus on other essential tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Medicaid Redetermination: Member Engagement Success Stories</h5>
When it comes to Medicaid redetermination, each state is doing things differently &mdash; and each has a different <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Carenet_RedeterminationList_Update.pdf">redetermination deadline.</a>
<blockquote class="blog-quote">&ldquo;Each Carenet client has unique timing needs and a sense of urgency,&rdquo; says Knight. &ldquo;We tailor our support and quickly scale to meet their needs.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<h5>Reaching Medicaid Enrollees in California</h5>
A California-based Medicaid plan administrator used text messages to initially reach out to its members. Through personalized live telephone interactions, Carenet followed up directly with members who left their texts unanswered.

Our Engagement team successfully reached thousands of members, ensuring that the Medicaid redetermination process was completed accurately.
<h5>Success Snapshot</h5>
<strong>11,228</strong> contacts
<strong>87.37%</strong> success rate
<h5>Medicaid Redetermination Success in Texas</h5>
One Texas-based, women&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s focused health maintenance organization (HMO) called on Carenet to assist with their Medicaid redetermination process. They mailed redetermination packets to members and relied on Carenet&rsquo;s medical call center to make follow-up calls.

Carenet&rsquo;s Engagement team connected with members, ensuring each understood the Medicaid re-enrollment requirements and, in many cases, walked them through packet completion.
<h5>Success Snapshot</h5>
<strong>23,027</strong> calls
<strong>80.76%</strong> success rate speaking with a member.
<h5>Overcoming Medicaid Redetermination Challenges</h5>
Medicaid redetermination is a complex process for beneficiaries and the organizations administering Medicaid programs. Challenges include:

<ul>
 	<li>Documentation burden: Beneficiaries may struggle to gather the required documentation, such as proof of income, citizenship or residency, leading to delays in the redetermination process.</li>
 	<li>Eligibility changes: Life circumstances change quickly, making it difficult for individuals to accurately report changes in income, family size or employment status.</li>
 	<li>Administrative complexity: Organizations responsible for managing Medicaid benefits may have limited resources and face administrative burdens in processing redetermination applications for their members.</li>
</ul>

Partnering with Carenet through the Medicaid redetermination process helps organizations streamline their administrative processes and ensures their members navigate the complexities of Medicaid reenrollment.

							Many of today&rsquo;s healthcare consumers start their patient journey on your website, which is why having an online scheduling system is vital for patient acquisition. However, it takes more than just deploying a patient scheduling system to drive adoption. The health systems that experience the greatest success with online scheduling integrate it into their long-term marketing and patient communication strategies.

<h5>Make Patient Scheduling Links Clear on Website and Mobile</h5>
Patients may not always start their journey on your health system&rsquo;s website, but their journey almost always leads them there. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to build online patient scheduling into your digital strategy to drive new visitors and conversions to your scheduling pages as well as advertise your facility&rsquo;s ability to conveniently schedule online.
<p class="check"><strong>Multiple Pages</strong> &mdash; give patients the ability to book appointments on every page of your website. Do this by including a scheduling link in the menu, on each carousel banner, with buttons, in strategic callouts, and in the footer of your site.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Mobile</strong> &mdash; ensure that online scheduling is highly visible and easy to locate from any mobile device. Also, confirm that calls-to-action render correctly on mobile, your registration form loads properly, and that everything is easily accessible.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>CTA Placement</strong> &mdash; place the call-to-action (CTA) above the fold on short pages with less content and both above and below the fold on longer pages that have more content.</p>
<span style="font-weight: 900; color: #f5b335; display: inline;"><span style="color: #d31c5b;">STAT:</span> </span>One client that uses <span class="ui-provider eo bvw bsi cbz cca ccb ccc ccd cce ccf ccg cch cci ccj cck ccl ccm ccn cco ccp dmz dna ccs cct ccu ccv ccw ccx ccy ccz cda cdb cdc cdd cde" dir="ltr">Carenet&rsquo;s Online Appointment Scheduling Solution</span> across more than 4,800 sites indicates mobile traffic is 2x higher than desktop.

<h5>Website Copy &amp; FAQs About Your Patient Scheduling System</h5>
Online scheduling should be convenient and simple, and so should the copy to promote it. Keep website copy and scheduling CTAs clear and concise. Start by incorporating the patient scheduling system into existing web copy in a harmonious way through backlinks, instructions, and answers to frequently asked questions.
<p class="check"><strong>FAQs</strong> &mdash; provide answers to frequently asked questions and revisit them periodically based on patient experiences and feedback.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Disclaimers</strong> &mdash; offer an online check-in disclaimer highlighting the fact that treatment times are not guaranteed.</p>
<span style="font-weight: 900; display: inline;">TIP:</span> Emphasize that online scheduling is free, easy-to-use, and available to all patients regardless of insurance status.

<h5>Promote Your Patient Scheduling System with Search Engine Marketing</h5>
Every healthcare practice wants to show up as the top search result on Google for services they provide. To be at the top of the search results on Google, it&rsquo;s crucial for your organization to increase the effectiveness of your search engine marketing (SEM) for your patient scheduling system.
<p class="check"><strong>Branded Pages and Vanity URLs</strong> &mdash; dedicated and branded web pages for online scheduling create additional opportunities for you to rank higher in Google searches on keywords relevant to service lines and facilities in your geographic market. Consider using vanity URLs to point web visitors to an abbreviated, branded page for quick access to your patient scheduling system.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Paid Search</strong> &mdash; carefully research keywords and optimize paid search campaigns to help you acquire new patients. Campaigns should be geotargeted based on your healthcare consumers&rsquo; locations and should leverage carefully curated and comprehensive sets of keywords for each facility or service line.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Boost Campaigns for New Schedules &mdash; </strong>develop boost campaigns for each new schedule to drive traffic for at least the first 90 days.</p>
<span style="font-weight: 900; color: #f5b335; display: inline;"><span style="color: #d31c5b;">STAT:</span> </span>One urgent care campaign drove 438 conversions with a CPA of $2.30 &amp; a 43% conversion rate over a three-month period.

<h5>Make it Easy for Patients to Schedule Appointments Online with Search Engine Optimization</h5>
A successful hospital, practice, or healthcare organization website facilitates patient communication and helps you win more of the patients you want. But this means little if patients can&rsquo;t find your website online. Your online scheduling landing pages should be optimized for search engine optimization (SEO) to ensure your scheduling pages are easily found when a patient searches for care.
<p class="check"><strong>Keyword Search</strong> &mdash; keyword research helps you identify keywords that appeal to your target audiences and expand the reach of your content. Use keyword research tools such as Google Ads, Moz, or SEMRush to help identify what kinds of content users are looking for on any given topic.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Google My Business</strong> &mdash; use Google My Business to claim the information of each of your health system&rsquo;s locations, add details about services, and personalize your business profiles on Google Search and Maps.</p>
<span style="font-weight: 900; color: #f5b335; display: inline;"><span style="color: #d31c5b;">STAT:</span> </span><span class="ui-provider eo bvw bsi cbz cca ccb ccc ccd cce ccf ccg cch cci ccj cck ccl ccm ccn cco ccp dmz dna ccs cct ccu ccv ccw ccx ccy ccz cda cdb cdc cdd cde" dir="ltr">In 2019, 34% of all patients who scheduled through Carenet&rsquo;s Online Appointment Scheduling Platform were new to the health system. Source: Carenet&rsquo;s Online Appointment Scheduling Platform Data, 2019.</span>
5
<h5>Use Social Media to Boost Your Patient Scheduling System</h5>
Integrate your patient scheduling system into your social strategy, educating patients on the availability of the service and pointing them to where they can convert. Sharing posts across system-managed social networks can encourage colleagues at other sites as well as employees to share posts on their social networks to connect with new audiences and amplify your reach.
<p class="check"><strong>Organic Posts</strong> &mdash; develop and nurture your followers without burdening the audience by following the rule of thirds with your social content: 33% should be promotion; 33% should share ideas from thought leaders or customers, and 33% should build your brand through engaging conversations.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Paid Posts</strong> &mdash; paid social media helps you target audiences and drive conversions with greater speed to market, campaign sustainability, and message frequency. Begin by setting your objectives, identifying your budget, and building your ads.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Hashtags</strong> &mdash; hashtags increase engagement, build brand awareness, add context, and help your audience find you. The best hashtags are relatively short and easy to remember but don&rsquo;t overuse them.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Measurement</strong> &mdash; measuring your success starts with setting goals around your initial strategy, then measuring the progress throughout the campaign.</p>
<span style="font-weight: 900; color: #d31c5b; display: inline;">TIP:</span> On Facebook, aim for two posts per day to keep your audience interested.

<h5>Public Relations Can Promote Online Patient Scheduling</h5>
Announcing the availability of your online patient scheduling system to the press emphasizes that patient-centric care and convenience are top priorities of your health system. For organizations with tighter budgets, PR can be one of the most cost-effective and trusted ways to reach a broad audience.
<p class="check"><strong>Hone Your Message</strong> &mdash; physician practices, laboratories, and other sites can let the press know that their calendar is now open to patients, that busy patients can now schedule appointments online 24/7 at a time that is convenient for them, and that same-day visits may be available.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>News Releases</strong> &mdash; a strong news release with a local angle highlighting a new service line is a great way to gain media attention. Place your release on one of the many newswires that distribute news directly to journalists.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Pitch the Press</strong> &mdash; target reporters who cover healthcare or consumer trends with a personalized pitch. Keep your email subject line short and specific.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Contributed Content</strong> &mdash; editorial teams can be limited and overloaded, so offering an expertly written article can help provide value to the publication&rsquo;s readership &mdash; and your partners in the press. Articles should be written as neutral thought leadership pieces, not an advertisement.</p>
<span style="font-weight: 900; color: #d31c5b; display: inline;">TIP:</span> Articles should be written as thought leadership pieces that are neutral but that elevate your company&rsquo;s key messages and leads the reader to believe in your value props.
7
<h5>Use Internal Communications to Support the Patient Scheduling System</h5>
Introducing your staff, affinity groups, and other stakeholders to online scheduling and online check-in supports successful adoption. You will also need to ensure online schedules are part of ongoing training, new hire orientation, and the integration plan for new sites or teams into your health system.
<p class="check"><strong>Across All Channels</strong> &mdash; when developing your internal communications plan, incorporate announcements, reminders, and details across all channels such as digital ads, social media, posters, flyers, and more.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Internal Education</strong> &mdash; be sure to provide regular educational opportunities of varying depth to reinforce learning and provide periodic updates. Consider regular webinars and training for stakeholders and users.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Identify a Champion</strong> &mdash; leadership and staff must support the rollout of the online patient scheduling system and serve as champions for its ongoing use. The champion should promote online scheduling with staff and monitor internal communications channels for its inclusion.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Announce It</strong> &mdash;your health system should send an initial email announcement with a link to the patient scheduling system. Be sure to include instructions, and, when appropriate, include a PDF of a panel card or flyer.</p>
<span style="font-weight: 900; color: #d31c5b; display: inline;">TIP:</span> When designing a slide about your online scheduling, remember to KISS &ndash; Keep it Simple &amp; Straightforward. The fewer words you need to prove a point, the better.
8
<h5>Print &amp; Patient Communications Can Publicize Online Scheduling Options</h5>
Amplify your digital marketing activities with print and patient communications. An omnichannel strategy with consistent messaging across the entire patient journey will help you attract and retain patients.
<p class="check"><strong>Print Collateral and Banners</strong> &mdash; provide print collateral such as appointment cards, panel cards, and flyers at registration, welcome desks, and reception areas. Use them in discharge packets and at community events, health fairs, and with partners</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Direct Mail</strong> &mdash; health systems see great success with direct mail. Develop dedicated campaigns to highlight how 24/7 scheduling or check-in facilitates patient access and convenience or include reminders in patient mailers.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Patient Communications</strong> &mdash; when working through your communication plans, be sure to integrate all your patient communication channels. Promote online scheduling in appointment reminders, emails, texts, on-hold messaging, IVR, and other channels that reach patients.</p>

9
<h5>Push Awareness of Your Patient Scheduling System with Traditional Advertising</h5>
Advertising offers a powerful way to capture patients and their families&rsquo; hearts, imaginations, and attention. Campaigns can emphasize the convenience, choice, and quality that online scheduling and online check-in offers patients and can help to improve loyalty and patient acquisition.
<p class="check"><strong>Print Ads</strong> &mdash; print ads can be a cost-effective way to promote online scheduling and attract new patients. Ads that address a specific problem, solution, and reasons to select you are the most effective.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Radio and TV</strong> &mdash; often used for its broad reach, broadcast advertising continues to be part of the marketing mix for many health systems looking to increase visibility and awareness in support of other direct response channels.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Outdoor</strong> &mdash; explore outdoor advertising based on your local market. Traditionally thought of as billboards, outdoor advertising now encompasses the full gamut of out-of-home (OOH) advertising.</p>
<span style="font-weight: 900; color: #d31c5b; display: inline;">TIP:</span> Campaigns can help improve loyalty and patient acquisition. Build your advertising mix based on your budget and target audience.
10
<h5>Focus on the Patient Experience</h5>
With many marketing channels covered, some organizations go the extra mile to help make online scheduling an exceptional patient experience. Spend some time thinking through innovative ways to reach patients and promote online scheduling.
<p class="check"><strong>Personalized Experiences</strong> &mdash; create personalized experiences for patients who use your online patient scheduling system. Consider offering a dedicated waiting room for patients who book their treatment time online or preferred parking spots for online scheduling users.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Reporting and Analytics</strong> &mdash; ensure you look at KPIs such as patient use, throughput, demographic patterns, and patient satisfaction. Use this data to measure overall performance and build lists of patients for personalized outreach.</p>
<p class="check"><strong>Staff Scripts</strong> &mdash; scripts help providers, front desk staff, and call center agents deliver friendly, personalized, and consistent greetings for patients who check-in or schedule appointments online.</p>

							<p><em>Carenet&rsquo;s recent report on member experience yielded surprising results. It turns out that Medicare &amp; Medicaid members feel more cared for by their insurance company than commercial plan members. Find out why.<br></em></p><p>The experience that insurance plan members have is important. Not only does a positive experience improve loyalty, it can also lead to improved outcomes. When members have easy access to healthcare services, clear communication about their coverage, and support in navigating the complex healthcare system, they are more likely to seek timely medical care and adhere to treatment plans.</p><h2>Surprising Member Experience Survey Results</h2><p><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/">Carenet</a>, a company that provides clinical telehealth and member/patient engagement services to payers as well as providers, recently released&nbsp;<a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/health-insurance-consumer-survey">a report</a>&nbsp;on plan member experience. That report was based on a survey of 1200 plan members conducted by the company. There were several surprising results:</p><ul><li>78.9% of Medicare members and 74.1% of Medicaid members felt their insurance company cared about their health and wellbeing while only 60.5% of those with commercial plans felt the same.</li><li>89.2% of plan members who are 60+ said using technology to manage their health is important</li><li>89.1% of respondents want phone reps who are &ldquo;well-versed in healthcare</li></ul><p><em>Swaay.Health&nbsp;</em>reached out to Carenet to discuss these results and John Erwin, CEO of Carenet agreed to come on camera to provide additional context.</p><h2>Medicare &amp; Medicaid Plan Members Feel Cared For</h2><p>&ldquo;I was surprised at how cared for Medicare and Medicaid plan members felt,&rdquo; shared Erwin. &ldquo;That is the opposite of conventional thinking. We&rsquo;re used to hearing about the struggles patients in that population have and how they are not as well supported as we would like. However, this result is telling us a different story.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you think about it, this population is much more dependent on their healthcare providers and also on the plans that they have,&rdquo; continued Erwin. &ldquo;When you look at it through this lens, it becomes pretty clear that the groups that need the healthcare support the most, are getting it.&rdquo;</p><p>Erwin was quick to point out that this does not mean that all is well with Medicare and Medicaid, but the survey result does indicate that these plan members are, for the most part, feeling supported by their insurance company.</p><h2>Older Plan Members Want to Use Technology</h2><p>Another survey result that was surprising, yet shouldn&rsquo;t be, was the high percentage of members older than 60 who felt it was important to use technology to manage their health. This is counter to the stereotype that the elderly do not want or know how to use tech.</p><p>&ldquo;This group is very up to speed with technology,&rdquo; said Erwin. &ldquo;They are using their iPhones hours per day. They have time. They have grandkids and other reason to be on Facebook. I&rsquo;m glad this survey picked it up because for us as a company, it means is that we need to really embrace them as tech-savvy consumers.&rdquo;</p>

							<p>The FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently approved</a> the first RSV vaccine (Arexvy) for seniors, infants, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-rsv-vaccine-pregnant-mothers-protect-babies-rcna100946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expectant mothers</a>&mdash; populations that are at the highest risk of serious complications from the virus. The new RSV vaccine was shown to significantly reduce the risk of <a href="https://www.rethinkrsv.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">severe RSV</a> complications in seniors in an ongoing large clinical study.</p>
<p>This year, the CDC <a href="https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2023/tripledemic-flu-rsv-covid-vaccines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommends</a> that adults aged 60+ get both the RSV and flu vaccines, in addition to regular COVID vaccines or boosters. To increase population vaccine coverage, healthcare providers and health plans need to reach out to eligible individuals. Carenet Health&rsquo;s <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/communication-and-reminders">Communication &amp; Reminders</a> and <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/intelligent-scheduling">Intelligent Scheduling</a> solutions can help you reach qualified patients and members to encourage them to get their RSV, flu, and COVID vaccines this fall.</p>
<h5>Carenet Helps Improve Vaccination Rates</h5>
<p>Despite high efficacy rates, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-dashboard.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46% of eligible Americans</a> did not get their flu shot during the 2022-23 season. <strong>How can providers and health plans increase the number of people who receive these life-saving vaccines?</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27145 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/46-percent-no-flu-shot.png" alt="46% of elegible americans did not get their flu shot during the 2022-23 season" width="800" height="200">Carenet&rsquo;s <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/communication-and-reminders">Communication &amp; Reminders</a> and <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/intelligent-scheduling">Intelligent Scheduling</a> solutions help providers and health plans efficiently and effectively engage patients and members through:</p>

<ul>
<li>Omnichannel vaccine reminders &amp; instructions</li>
<li>Message broadcast</li>
<li>Convenient digital self-scheduling</li>
<li>Live voice scheduling</li>
<li>Medicare/Medicaid member outreach</li>
</ul>

<h5><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/communication-and-reminders"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27147 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5-solutions-to-help-coverage.png" alt="5 solutions to help increase population vaccine coverage 1 omnichcnnel vaccine reminders and instructions 2 message broadcaste 3 convenient digital self-scheduling 4 live voice scheduling 5 medicare medicaid member outreach" width="1667" height="792"></a></h5>
<h5>Omnichannel Patient and Member Engagement Drives Results</h5>
<p>Carenet&rsquo;s omnichannel support for communication, reminders, and scheduling enables patients and health plan members to be contacted via their preferred mode of communication, whether that&rsquo;s text message, email, or live phone call. Carenet&rsquo;s <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/2022-us-consumer-healthcare-trends-survey">2022 Patient Engagement Survey</a> found that older adults with PCPs were most likely to respond to phone calls (49%) from their provider&rsquo;s office, followed by email (23%), and text messages (13%). Younger adults showed a less strong preference for phone calls (37%), followed by email (23%) and texts (17%).</p>
<p>The survey also found that the majority of patients prefer at least one appointment reminder. Of respondents who had missed an appointment in the past year, 27% forgot about their appointment, and 24% did not reschedule the appointment. Multiple omnichannel appointment reminders can help patients remember to schedule and attend their appointments, which is crucial this vaccine season.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple top hospitals and health systems have leveraged Carenet&rsquo;s patient engagement solutions to increase appointments scheduled and decrease no-shows. </strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/communication-and-reminders"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27148 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/reduction-in-no-show-rate.png" alt="reduction in no show rate from 20% to 80% at a large children's hospital through carenet's communication and reminders solutions, while improving engagement through multilanguage patient support" width="800" height="380"></a></strong></p>
<p>At an east-coast children&rsquo;s hospital, Carenet&rsquo;s <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/communication-and-reminders">Communication &amp; Reminders</a> solution reduced the no-show rate from 20% to 8%, while also improving engagement through multilanguage patient support.</p>

<p>Another large health system, based in the mid-west and operating in 21 states and the District of Columbia, achieved a 72.5% increase in urgent care online visits scheduled and 100,000 additional visits in one year after implementing <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/intelligent-scheduling">Carenet Scheduling.</a></p>
<h5>Engage Patients and Members Today for a Healthier Tomorrow</h5>
<p>Healthcare providers and health plans can encourage eligible individuals to get their RSV and flu vaccines and improve population vaccine coverage through the right combination of intelligent communication and scheduling services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Carenet&rsquo;s strategies such as high-risk patient/member outreach, omnichannel scheduling, and more help to engage patients and members in their own health and improve community care access and health outcomes.</p>

							<h5><em>New study reveals member perceptions about their commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid plans</em></h5>
<p><strong>SAN ANTONIO &ndash; August 15, 2023</strong> &ndash; Carenet Health, a leading provider of 24/7 and on-demand patient engagement solutions, today announced the findings of its first consumer health insurance report, that reveals members&rsquo; perceptions about their insurance plans and validates their demand for improved experiences. As healthcare costs across the country continue to rise and consumers have increasing options to choose from to manage their care experience, the survey findings provide an in-depth overview of how members view their commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid insurance plans.</p>
<p>The findings in the report, <em>Healthcare Consumer Insights: Understanding the Health Insurance Member Experience,</em> uncover opportunities for insurance carriers to improve their overall member experience through more personalized customer support, better education surrounding available benefits, and the importance of fostering trust and a sense of empathy for members. Included in the findings, the survey reveals that 78.9% of Medicare members feel their insurer cares about their health and wellbeing; nearly half (44.6%) of Medicaid members have accessed their insurer&rsquo;s nurse help line; and 30.7% of all respondents were not aware of all the benefits in their health plan. </p>
<p>&ldquo;By taking a comprehensive look into the relationship between health insurance companies and the individuals they serve, Carenet has unveiled a range of perceptions &ndash; some of them surprising &ndash; that members of private and public health plans have about customer service, their knowledge of the benefits available to them, how they communicate with their plans, and much more,&rdquo; said Carenet Health Vice President of CX Analytics Bo Young. &ldquo;As the industry&rsquo;s leading healthcare consumer engagement company, Carenet is using the findings to continually elevate our exceptional payer solutions that simplify and modernize the member experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key report findings reveal that:</p>
<h5>Members Believe Their Insurance Company Cares </h5>
<p>Most Medicare members (78.9%) and Medicaid members (74.1%) said they feel that their insurance company cares about their health and wellbeing. However, only 60.5% of those with commercial plans said they think their insurance company cares about their health and wellbeing. The perception of Medicare members who feel that their insurer cares about them has a direct correlation with brand loyalty, as nine out of 10 respondents insured by Medicare (91.1%) indicated that they are either very loyal or moderately loyal to their insurance company. </p>
<h5>Medicare and Medicaid Plans Foster More Trust than Commercial Insurers &nbsp;</h5>
<p>More than 84% of Medicare members and nearly 75% of Medicaid members rated their level of trust in their insurance company as either good or excellent, compared with just under 65% of those with commercial insurance who felt the same way. These findings challenge the assumption that the commercial insurance consumer experience is inherently superior to Medicare and Medicaid. As most respondents (60.8%) who recently contacted their insurance company did so by phone, it&rsquo;s critical for insurers to foster member trust by providing well-trained, compassionate contact center staffers.</p>
<h5>More Than One-Third Experienced a Phone Support Language Barrier</h5>
<p>When asked to rate the quality of telephone support they receive across eight industries, healthcare ranked in the top three, with banks in the top slot, followed by health providers and health insurance. <br>
  In healthcare, the findings revealed that 34.7% of those surveyed said that a conversation with their insurer was hampered by a language barrier. As the number of Americans who speak a language other than English in their home tripled between 1980 and 2019, it&rsquo;s critical that health insurance phone support includes multi-language capabilities to provide equitable customer service to all members. </p>
<p>Furthermore, an overwhelming majority of respondents (89.1%) want phone representatives who are well-versed in healthcare. Among the respondents who ranked health insurance companies unfavorably for phone support, 45.7% said the representative did not understand their issue. The findings also revealed that 52% of respondents indicated they waited too long to speak to a representative and 43.3% had to repeat the reason for the call after being transferred. </p>
<h5>Insight Into the Health Insurance Customer Experience</h5>
<p>To gain insight into the relationship between health insurance companies and the members they serve and to learn more about members&rsquo; perception of the health insurance customer experience, Carenet asked questions about trust, empathy, wait times, language barriers, and more. Based on a third-party survey of more than 1,200 adult respondents in the United States who have health insurance, the report provides an in-depth overview on how members really feel about their insurance carriers.</p>

							<h2 class="blog-subhead">Three Essential Approaches for Effective Medicaid Population Engagement</h2><p>Today&rsquo;s Medicaid programs and <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/managed-care/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managed care organizations</a> (MCOs) need to improve costs at the same time as they improve quality and outcomes for vulnerable populations. However, connecting with and encouraging members to take needed health-related next steps can be complicated.</p><p>Factors that contribute to this challenge include invalid and frequently changing contact information, low health literacy, lack of childcare, and access to transportation. This complexity demands a specialized member engagement approach that can address the specific needs of the Medicaid health plan population.</p><p>At <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/what-we-do">Carenet Health,</a> we typically recommend three essential strategy components for effective Medicaid community engagement:</p><ul><li>Proactive outreach</li><li>24/7 <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions">on-demand telehealth care</a></li><li>Around-the-clock support for plan members</li></ul><p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at each one.</p><h2 class="blog-subhead">Proactive Outreach to Medicaid Members</h2><p>To boost member communication, health literacy, care management, compliance, patient satisfaction and outcomes, you&rsquo;ll need solid pre-emptive outreach. And that outreach needs to be carried out by contact support teams who understand this specific population&rsquo;s needs and barriers to care.</p><p>Those teams should be trained in demonstrating empathy and understanding, using <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/beyond-engagement-strategies-for-persuasion-and-influence">motivational conversation tactics</a> and working with individuals to uncover their obstacles to getting the health and wellness information and care they need.</p><p>There are a few specific healthcare areas that your proactive Medicaid strategies should focus on here to give you the best ROI and member activation rates. (Activation rates are numbers that quantify how many of your health plan members take predetermined, specific actions after being contacted.)</p><h2 class="blog-subhead">Proactive outreach strategies should focus on:</h2><ul><li><span style="color: #f04b24; font-weight: bold;">ED Avoidance</span> &ndash; Emergency room (or emergency department) avoidance is one of those targeted areas. With this kind of upfront engagement, <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/how-to-improve-your-health-plans-er-diversion-strategy">you can reach out to frequent flyers and low-acuity ED users</a> and help them transition to more appropriate and less expensive care options. This should be a key educational initiative.</li><li><span style="color: #f04b24; font-weight: bold;">Member Onboarding</span> &ndash; Another critical area of upfront communication is member onboarding. This is often your best chance of contacting some members of your Medicaid population because you have very recent contact information, and that information can change frequently when a member is experiencing housing and job insecurity or stops and starts with different mobile phone carriers. Use your member onboarding/welcome engagement to tackle as many needs as possible. Educate members about the importance of well child visits, immunizations and other services, as well as the availability of resources such as a Nurse Advice Line and virtual care coordination that require no transportation access. Combine <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/the-power-of-personal/">health risk assessment</a> completion with your welcome communications.</li><li><span style="color: #f04b24; font-weight: bold;">Perinatal and Well Child Communications</span> &ndash; Two other important areas of Medicaid member engagement efforts include perinatal and well child exam communications. Connect with those members who are expecting a child and identify indicators of high-risk pregnancies and offer targeted, timely interventions that can ultimately improve health outcomes for both parents and infants. Explain the importance of well child visits and regular check-ups. Discuss the importance of a consistent provider-patient relationship and assist with appointment scheduling via three-way conference calls.</li></ul><p><strong>Learn more about how your organization can benefit by leveraging Carenet solutions to address:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/strategic-engagement-solution-ed-diversion-success-story">ED Avoidance</a></li><li><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/7-key-steps-for-successfully-onboarding-and-cultivating-member-relationships">Member Onboarding</a></li><li><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/how-are-you-improving-care-access-for-child-and-adolescent-medicaid-beneficiaries">Care Management for Child Medicaid Beneficiaries</a></li></ul><h2 class="blog-subhead">On-Demand Telehealth Care Available to Members 24/7</h2><p>Since you likely offer 24/7 access to on-demand virtual care, be sure your Medicaid members know about the different types (nurse advice lines, online behavioral health crisis lines, remote patient monitoring), and that they understand how easy it is to use, and what types of issues it can be used for.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Communicate that it&rsquo;s free and convenient</li><li>Prominently display on member benefit an appointment cards</li><li>Publish it on all consumer explanation of benefit (EOB) documents</li><li>Plan automated reminder communications / emails</li></ul><p>See a full list of additional ways to <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/15-tips-to-increase-nurse-advice-line-utilization">increase telehealth communication awareness among Medicaid members here,</a> and check out these Carenet virtual care solutions:</p><ul><li><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ede72eec-c91b-43cb-a8fe-2dd7c30495d4.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nurse Advice Services</a></li><li><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/one-stop-behavioral-health-crisis-support-delivers-95-ed-diversion">Online Behavioral Health Crisis Support</a></li><li><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/remote-patient-monitoring-program-improving-care-comfort-and-costs">Remote Patient Monitoring</a></li></ul><h2 class="blog-subhead">Around-the-Clock Support for Plan Members</h2><p>Medicaid plans should also consider the benefit of member support services that never close. Think about that individual who works two jobs and gets home from the last one at 2 a.m. That&rsquo;s the only time he or she may have to connect with you. Translation services, of course, are important and should be just as available as your 24/7 support: after normal hours, on weekends and holidays.</p><p>These after-hours support teams should be able to handle everything from benefits eligibility questions to transportation coordination to referrals to providers and programs.</p><h2 class="blog-subhead">How to Engage Medicaid Members Through Outreach Channels</h2><p>Once you&rsquo;ve outlined your care, support and outreach plans, you need to consider what channels you&rsquo;ll use to reach your Medicaid audience. Automated voice messaging is a nice tool to have in your toolkit, especially for reminder messages, and text messaging can often reach members who can&rsquo;t be reached any other way.</p><p>However, it&rsquo;s also important to remember that healthcare is a highly personal matter, and rarely are minds changed about things like making a needed appointment (that can be tinged with fear and anxiety) via only an email or other digital patient communication. One-to-one human connections are still the best and most powerful way to have those conversations with meaningful results.</p><p><strong><em>Carenet Health recommends 3 essential strategy components for effective Medicaid community engagement:</em></strong></p><img src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/infographic.jpg" alt="Carenet Health recommends 3 essential strategy components for effective Medicaid community engagement proactive outreach 24/7 on-demand telehealth around-the-clock support for plan members"><a style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; text-align: center; text-transform: uppercase;" href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/hubfs/2023%20Content%20Files/Carenet%20Health%20-%20Medicaid%20Engagement%20Infographic.pdf?utm_campaign=2023-08-Blog-Medicaid%20Member%20Enagement&amp;utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Medicaid%20Member%20Engagement%20Infographic&amp;utm_term=Medicaid%20Member%20Engagement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download the full infographic here</a><p style="margin-top: 30px;">Want to talk more about health plan engagement?

			<h2 class="blog-subhead">Four ways to help reduce unnecessary emergency room visits in your health plan population</h2>
  <p>Health plans need to lower Emergency Department costs, no matter what type of populations they serve&mdash;from Medicaid and Medicare to private, commercial plan members. Non-urgent emergency room visits cost the U.S. <a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/nhqrdr/chartbooks/carecoordination/measure2.html" target="_blank">$4.4 billion annually</a>. Reasons for non-urgent ED visits include lack of knowledge of other care options and lack of access to non-emergency care. One CDC study found that 80% of adults visited emergency departments because they couldn't get the care they needed from a primary care physician, and a <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/sustainability/doctor-shortages-are-here-and-they-ll-get-worse-if-we-don-t-act" target="_blank">growing shortage</a> of primary care doctors is expected to further compound this issue.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, there are several steps health plans can take to turn the tide. As a healthcare engagement and telehealth partner, Carenet optimizes health plans' ED diversion programs and reduces costs associated with avoidable ED visits. </p>
   <p> Here are four ED diversion strategies we believe can help your organization prevent unnecessary ED visits and the associated costs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proactive healthcare member education and engagement</li>
  <li>Post-ED visit follow-up </li>
  <li>Health plan provider selection and appointment scheduling</li>
  <li>Telehealth care promotion and coordination</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/refined-best-practice-tactics.png" alt="Carenet has gained and refined these best-practice tactics from our work with more than 75 of the nation's premier health plans.">

  <h2 class="blog-subhead">1. Proactive Healthcare Member Education and Engagement</h2>

<p>Research shows that a large segment of health plan members is simply unfamiliar with how their insurance coverage works and unaware of care setting options. That makes pre-emptive education critical for helping members receive the right care at the right time while keeping costs down.</p>
<p>At Carenet, we know that a comprehensive and consistent engagement initiative can help. The strategy should be multi-channel, multi-touch and multi-seasonal. Incorporating information into member onboarding communications and welcome calls works especially well as an educational primer, but a "one-and-done" approach without continuing follow-up won't be enough to have a lasting effect.</p>
<p>Prioritizing targeted population segments, such as high-cost/high-need or ED super users, can drive substantial progress, as well. Personalizing individual communications based on claims, demographic and other data will deliver heightened relevancy. Overall, proactive member education can help members choose the most appropriate care setting, improving emergency department/hospital diversion for conditions that are treatable with non-emergency care.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/CarenetHealth_Behavioral_Health_Crisis_Support_CaseStudy.pdf" target="_blank">partnership</a> with a large, 15-state health plan serving 5 million Medicaid and Medicare Advantage members, Carenet's ongoing member engagement and telehealth behavioral health support helped 95% of participating members avoid expensive behavioral health-related ED admissions. </p>
<h2 class="blog-subhead">After seven months of the Carenet program, member satisfaction was high, and the health plan was more resource-efficient and cost-effective. </h2>

<h2 class="blog-subhead">2. Post-ED Visit Follow-Up</h2>

<p>Communication and education after an ED visit can also be beneficial in preventing future avoidable use. At Carenet, we've seen good results (and in one case, a 3:1 ROI) by conducting follow-up calls within 72 hours of ED discharge.</p>
<p>In one specific client case , our engagement team initiated a quick intervention after one unwarranted ED visit versus the plan's original strategy of three visits. A list of the most frequent non-urgent ED conditions, such as sinusitis and sprained ankle, was used as the trigger for outreach. This ER diversion strategy resulted in $14 million in cost-savings over the course of several years.</p>

<a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/strategic-engagement-solution-er-diversion-success-story"><img src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/partnership-with-large-health-plan.png" alt="In another partnership with a large US health plan, Carenet identified and provided intervention to nearly 9,000 first-time non-urgent ER users over four months, saving the health plan a projected $700,000+ annually."></a>

<h2 class="blog-subhead">3. Health Plan Provider Selection and Appointment Scheduling</h2>

<p>Helping healthcare consumers develop a relationship with a primary care physician is important for member health and wellness, as well as appropriate resource utilization and <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/who-we-serve/health-plans">health plan performance</a>. </p>
<p>Selecting a doctor from a plan's in-network list can be overwhelming, and too many plan websites and provider lists are out of date. That's why a high-touch communications strategy and <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/intelligent-scheduling">scheduling </a>support like Carenet's can make a big difference in helping plan members make their best-fit provider decisions earlier (when there is no pressing care concern) rather than later (when stress and worry levels are high). Plus, connecting members with primary care doctors helps ensure better preventive care and treatment adherence&mdash;which also helps them stay out of the ED. </p>

  <h2 class="blog-subhead">4. Telehealth Care Promotion and Coordination</h2>

<p>Three-quarters of all doctors, urgent care and ED visits are either unnecessary or can be handled safely over the phone or by video, and 80% of consumers are open to telehealth for non-emergency care. </p>
<p>Many healthcare consumers are simply not aware of the virtual treatment and care options they can access through their plan. That's why all plans typically need to boost their promotion of their telehealth resources to <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/six-ways-to-stimulate-telehealth-utilization-in-your-health-plan-population/">improve utilization</a>. Carenet's member engagement and <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">telehealth services</a> help health plans to promote alternate care routes and reduce unnecessary ED visits.</p>
<p>Resource promotion should include <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CarenetHealth_Nurse-Advice-Line_InfoSheet.pdf" target="_blank">nurse triage and advice lines</a>, MD e-consults, comprehensive Virtual Clinics and virtual/telemedicine behavioral health access points&mdash;all staffed by the same quality of clinicians found in traditional brick-and-mortar care settings.</p>
<p>Amping up your telehealth communications to members in rural and underserved urban communities is an excellent place to start the process of improving your ED diversion program.</p>

							<p>It&rsquo;s been great connecting with our clients and friends from across the healthcare industry at the <a href="https://www.ahip.org/conferences/ahip-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AHIP</a> and RISE 2023 conferences. These events provided a fantastic platform for learning, networking, and we learned some valuable insights from industry peers, customers, and new colleagues.</p><p><strong>Here&rsquo;s a quick recap of the issues and conversations we shared which made this year&rsquo;s AHIP and RISE conferences memorable and highly attended healthcare industry events.</strong></p><p><span style="text-align: var(--text-align); color: #d31c5b; font-weight: bold;">1. HRAs:</span><span style="text-align: var(--text-align);"> Managing the volume of health risk assessment (HRA) outreach necessary to understand member populations is increasingly challenging. As reliance on technology solutions alone is commonplace, Carenet Health&rsquo;s Chief Client Officer Vikie Spulak, explains why </span><a style="text-align: var(--text-align); background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://carenethealthcare.com/the-power-of-personal">a human-anchored approach to HRAs</a><span style="text-align: var(--text-align);"> is a more effective way to gather this vital information.</span></p><p>&ldquo;HRAs provide a crucial view into member and population health, so why rely on technology alone to collect necessary information?&rdquo; she asks.</p><p style="color: #fff!important; font-style: italic!important; margin-bottom: 10px!important;">&ldquo;Our experience implementing hundreds of HRA programs through the years has shown that passive digital methods alone do not significantly increase HRA completion rates.&rdquo;</p><p style="color: #fff!important; text-align: right!important; margin-bottom: 0!important;">Vikie Spulak, Chief Client Officer, Carenet Health.</p><p>Using digital tools can still be a smart way to gather needed information, but certain groups and individuals simply <strong>respond better to one-on-one interaction than more impersonal tactics such as automated phone calls or emails</strong>. Effectively engaging, educating, and activating members throughout the HRA experience builds rapport and trust, fostering accountability.</p><p style="color: #852065!important; font-weight: 700!important; font-style: italic!important;">The significance of Health Risk Assessments and how they can drive proactive healthcare management is often overlooked and must not be underestimated for proven efficiencies in population health management, and higher HRA completion rates.</p><p><span style="color: #d31c5b; font-weight: bold;"> 2. Member Advocacy:</span> Since the pandemic, a lot has changed in the ways providers and plans interact with patients and members alike. Savvy healthcare consumers have become more aware of their choices. Whether it&rsquo;s a telehealth versus in-office visit, at-home lab work. or making an appointment by SMS or online, <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/the-connected-consumer-journey-improving-member-experience-by-orchestrating-all-clinical-and-non-clinical-touchpoints">they want seamless, satisfying experiences around the clock.</a></p><p>Not only are members behaving in new ways, but health plan leaders are as well. They are beginning to see their market in the same customer-centric, retail-oriented way that banking, telecommunications, and retailers see theirs: a place where customer care along every point of the consumer experience matters. <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/health-insurance-consumer-survey">By re-envisioning this experience, the health plan industry can see increased cost savings, efficiencies, and outcomes.</a></p><p>Traditionally, healthcare organizations have siloed their touchpoints, outsourcing as much as 30% to multiple suppliers. Today, <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/the-connected-consumer-journey-improving-member-experience-by-orchestrating-all-clinical-and-non-clinical-touchpoints">more healthcare organizations are responding by seeking consolidation strategies</a> that reduce internal costs, internal infrastructure IT costs, and vendor management challenges, while improving member health outcomes.</p><p style="color: #852065!important; font-weight: 700!important; font-style: italic!important;">How healthcare organizations advocate for their members is increasingly important &ndash; carefully managed interactions, be it from coaching, testing, or offering dedicated telehealth, supports personalized care, resulting in meaningful patient and member engagement.</p><p><span style="color: #d31c5b; font-weight: bold;">3. Risk Adjustment and Impact:</span> Health plans are working in the weeks and months ahead to obtain and document updated member information during the <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/prepare-for-2023-medicaid-redeterminations">post-pandemic Medicaid redetermination process.</a></p><p>As states and managed care organizations (MCOs) contend with the end of Medicaid&rsquo;s continuous enrollment period, now is a critical time for health plans to ensure they are <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/drive-hra-success-through-customized-member-engagement">optimizing their Medicaid and Medicare health risk assessment (HRA) processes.</a> Low completion rates, engagement strategies that lack personalization, relevance, and choice, as well as outdated outreach tactics, are all factors that can drive substandard HRA data.</p><p>Proactive steps to address opportunities for health and wellness intervention include providing multi-language support, follow-up strategies for non-participants, and resources in place to integrate collected data into member profiles as quickly as possible.</p><p>By following best practices and deploying innovative approaches to collecting information, organizations can achieve robust response metrics to effectively evaluate members&rsquo; health risks.</p><p style="color: #852065!important; font-weight: 700!important; font-style: italic!important;">To provide members with cost-effective, quality care, health plans should routinely refine their efforts to comply with the requirements of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to maintain member information that&rsquo;s accurate, up-to-date, and complete.</p><p>We believe that together, we can make a significant impact on improving healthcare delivery and outcomes for the populations we serve, which is one of many reasons we appreciate attending events like RISE and AHIP.</p><p><a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/contact-carenet"><img class="alignnone wp-image-26972 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/contact_carenet_callout.jpg" alt="Is your organization ready to embrace a customer-centric, holistic plan?

							<p>June is Men&rsquo;s Health Month, an annual observance that encourages men and their families to prioritize health and healthy habits while raising awareness about men&rsquo;s health. Men in the United States face significant health challenges, with higher mortality rates compared to women in leading causes of death such as heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injuries, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db355.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p><p>Additionally, men often experience a higher burden of disease, including a <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/mars-vs-venus-the-gender-gap-in-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">propensity for various illnesses like</a> aortic aneurysms, emphysema, gout, kidney stones, and more. Unfortunately, male patients are often disengaged when it comes to their health. However, Men&rsquo;s Health Month provides a platform to help men make positive behavior changes. In this article, we will discuss three patient engagement strategies that healthcare providers can employ to effectively engage men in their health and well-being.</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-26752 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/men-higher-propensity-for-illness.jpg" alt="men have a higher propensity for a wide range of illnesses" width="700" height="400"></p><h5>Develop Multi-Channel Outreach Campaigns:</h5><p>To foster male patient engagement, it is crucial to educate them about the significance of actively participating in their healthcare. Implementing multi-channel patient outreach that focuses on preventive care and health awareness can be highly effective. One strategy is to send informative self-care tips and facts via text messages and/or email. For instance, you can include information on the benefits of physical activity, stress reduction techniques, or even allow patients to self-register for upcoming classes and events via text or email. Another effective approach is to create a monthly newsletter tailored specifically for male patients, which can be distributed via email, containing valuable health information and insights.</p><p>Utilize appointment reminders as an opportunity to encourage male patients to prioritize regular checkups, screening tests, and immunizations. Emphasize how certain diseases and conditions may not display noticeable symptoms, highlighting the importance of early detection through regular checkups. Creating social media posts that educate your followers about men&rsquo;s health statistics can also be an effective way to raise awareness. For instance, you can share a post stating, &ldquo;Did you know that men in the United States die on average five years earlier than women? June is Men&rsquo;s Health Awareness Month. Now is the perfect time to schedule your annual wellness visit or remind the men in your life to do so.&rdquo;</p><p>By leveraging our patient outreach solution, you can customize communications to optimize patient engagement, delivering the right message at the right time and through the right channel to drive higher conversions and encourage adherence to treatment plans. (link to solution one pager?)</p><h5>Promote Educational Offerings and Classes:</h5><p>Most healthcare organizations offer patient or member education programs addressing various health issues relevant to male patients, such as testicular and prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease, skin cancer, lung cancer, diabetes, gout, and more. However, the challenge lies in ensuring male attendance for these programs. Tailoring outreach for classes and events based on male patients&rsquo; interests can significantly improve participation rates.</p><p>Consider incorporating popular sporting events like March Madness, the Super Bowl, the World Series, or the World Cup into your promotional efforts to better engage men beyond the month of June. For example, host a sports-themed tournament where men can form teams and compete against each other. This not only provides an enjoyable experience but also serves as an opportunity to educate and encourage men to maintain an active lifestyle.</p><p>To further <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/class-event-registration-lp">maximize attendance of your classes and events</a>, consider offering virtual or hybrid programs. In fact, Optum&rsquo;s study &ldquo;<a href="https://www.optum.com/content/dam/optum/resources/whitePapers/100819_OptumHealth_Gender-Worksite_Engagement_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>How Gender and Work Site Impact Employee Engagement&rdquo;</strong></a>&nbsp;found that when asked about what prevents you from taking steps to lead a healthier life, 50% of men cited work demands as a limiting factor.</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-26753 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/50-percent-work-too-hard.jpg" alt="when asked about what prevents you from taking steps to lead a healthier life 50% cite work demands" width="700" height="400"></p><p>Offering virtual or hybrid options allows men to participate in educational programs without the constraints of time and location. Our Health &amp; Wellness Campaigns can assist you in ensuring that your patients attend appointments and receive necessary care, including preventive screenings, wellness visits, vaccines, and disease-specific and general education.</p><h5>Make Scheduling An Appointment Easy</h5><p>Since men are less engaged in their care than women, you need to ensure it&rsquo;s easy for men to find the right physician and the right venue of care at the right time. Utilize an&nbsp;<a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/best-practices-in-patient-scheduling-for-healthcare-marketers/">online patient scheduling solution</a> that allows male patients to schedule their appointments online at their convenience. With busy schedules and a lack of patient engagement,&nbsp;<a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-intelligent-scheduling-solution">online scheduling</a>&nbsp;makes it easy for men to convert at the time of intent.</p><p>Start by incorporating third-party validation and reviews into your campaigns. By highlighting your hospital&rsquo;s successes, you can help men engender confidence and feel more at ease with your system. Discuss success rates, quality awards, and technology capabilities that relate to a procedure they may need.<br>According to a <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/many-americans-don-t-have-a-primary-care-doctor#:~:text=Many%20Americans%20report%20they%20don,according%20to%20a%20government%20survey." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>government survey</strong></a>, 28% of men in the U.S. do not have a primary care physician. Knowing this, you should ask your male patients that enter your facility if they have a PCP or not. If they don&rsquo;t, take the time to&nbsp;<a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-patient-outreach-solution"><strong>follow up via email, text, or phone call</strong></a> and gain their commitment to a broader range of care within your health system.</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-26754 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/28-percent-no-physician.jpg" alt="28% of men in the u.s. do not have a primary physician" width="700" height="400"></p><p>Don&rsquo;t forget to utilize online scheduling for virtual appointments too. Offering the convenience of a virtual visit can ensure that your male patients have every opportunity to schedule an appointment, no matter their schedule.</p><p>However, you must utilize <strong>virtual visits for the correct appointment type</strong>, such as general health, follow-up visits, and sharing testing results. If your male patients prefer a mix of in person and virtual visits, set up a hybrid care appointment schedule.</p><p>Our patient self-scheduling solutions&nbsp;offers robust physician search capabilities, including the ability to search by location, appointment type, insurance accepted, appointment date or time range, as well as toggle between list and map view to see where providers are located visually.</p><p><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/patient-engagement-recoup-revenue/">Driving patient engagement</a> in male patients is critical to their overall health. While Men&rsquo;s Health Awareness Month presents the opportunity to engage your male patients, improving men&rsquo;s health outcomes should be a priority throughout the year.

							<p>The post-pandemic Medicaid redetermination has begun, and as many as 14 million current Medicaid members could lose critical coverage. Carenet is assisting health plans with Medicaid member outreach to help them navigate the redetermination process. &nbsp;Proactive communication and ongoing support are crucial to ensuring that vulnerable populations maintain their coverage and health plans retain their valuable Medicaid members.</p><h5>Medicaid Member Redetermination Outreach and Support is Critical</h5><p><a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/www.kff.org/medicaid/poll-finding/the-unwinding-of-medicaid-continuous-enrollment-knowledge-and-experiences-of-enrollees/___.YXAzOmNhcmVuZXRoZWFsdGg6YTpvOjc2NGY4YmZkMWYxZWVkOWYwYjc1Zjc1MWIyMDI0NGQ3OjY6YTdlMjowMGIxZDQ5ZDNlYzVkYzE2MTFiODhkZDMyNTI3MDc4ZjU5M2QwMWE1OTA2ZmJhY2FjMjRhNDI4N2MwMDQ5MjM2OnA6VA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A recent poll by KFF</a> found that nearly 2/3 (or 65%) of current Medicaid members are unaware of the redetermination process and are at risk of disenrollment due to outdated contact information or <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/www.beckerspayer.com/policy-updates/cms-substantial-portion-of-medicaid-terminations-due-to-procedural-reasons.html___.YXAzOmNhcmVuZXRoZWFsdGg6YTpvOjc2NGY4YmZkMWYxZWVkOWYwYjc1Zjc1MWIyMDI0NGQ3OjY6NzY0MDo0ZDgxNmRiOWUzNjk2MjllNThhMTc3MzE2YWU4NTc0NjBmMTYxY2QzMmE5NjYzMTA3M2I5YjE1OWU2NTlkZDk0OnA6VA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">procedural red tape</a>, despite continued eligibility based on income.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26663 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/medicaid-redetermination-callout.jpg" alt="6f5% of current medicaid members are unaware of the redetermination process" width="800" height="267"></p><h5>Health Plans Must Help Medicaid Members With:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Carenet_RedeterminationList_Update.pdf">Redetermination deadlines</a></li><li>Eligibility requirements</li><li>Up-to-date contact information</li><li>Required paperwork</li></ul><h5>3 Things Health Plans Can Do to Help Medicaid Members With Redetermination</h5><ol><li>Call members to confirm eligibility requirements, update contact information and share required paperwork and deadlines.</li><li>Text reminders to members with important dates and links to documents and information.</li><li>Setup hotlines to answer any questions along the redetermination process.</li></ol><p>Carenet is currently working with several major health plans to manage their member engagement for Medicaid redetermination.</p><p>For example, we recently developed a combined digital and live outreach campaign on behalf of a large Texas plan. Our team is assisting members with eligibility by helping them update their contact information and complete required paperwork. So far, we have successfully connected with 40% of the plan&rsquo;s Medicaid members and assisted 95% of those members with redetermination. Together we are ensuring these members don&rsquo;t lose critical coverage.</p><p>We are also supporting a non-profit health plan in California with their redetermination efforts and much more.&nbsp; In addition to helping them identify and contact members who are at risk of disenrollment, our <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/medicaid-member-engagement-strategies-that-work">strategic member engagement solutions</a> have had a significant impact on their quality scores and health assessment completion rates.&nbsp; Combined with our 24&times;7 Nurse Triage support, we have contributed to the success of this plan since our partnership began in 2019.</p><h5>Carenet Helps Clients With the Redetermination Process By:</h5><ul><li><strong>Activating members</strong> to opt-in to text reminders and update their contact information with enrollment agencies</li><li><strong>Identifying and providing outreach</strong> to high-cost, high-need members who are determined to be at risk of disenrollment</li><li><strong>Supporting members</strong> in completing their redetermination paperwork and answering members&rsquo; questions about redetermination through inbound and outbound calls</li><li><strong>Elevating member retention</strong> to reduce gaps in care and coverage</li></ul><h5>Medicaid Members Need Engagement Now More Than Ever</h5><p>Because each state has its own Medicaid program with unique eligibility rules, <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/www.kff.org/policy-watch/what-do-the-early-medicaid-unwinding-data-tell-us/___.YXAzOmNhcmVuZXRoZWFsdGg6YTpvOjc2NGY4YmZkMWYxZWVkOWYwYjc1Zjc1MWIyMDI0NGQ3OjY6MTYxZDoyYzYyN2YzNDU4OTkyMTcxMmNlZDMxZTRhMjE4YzM1NzkxZTNiMzRiNjU3MzY3YTgwYjY0Mzc5MmQ4NDI1NjIzOnA6VA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certain state populations are more vulnerable to losing coverage</a> than others. Individuals&rsquo; risk of losing coverage can also vary depending on factors such as age, socioeconomic status, language barriers, and other social determinants of health. Some states have stricter eligibility criteria for Medicaid, including lower income thresholds and more stringent asset limits. Additionally, Medicaid members living in states with limited outreach and education efforts regarding the redetermination process may be at higher risk of losing coverage due to lack of awareness of eligibility requirements and <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Carenet_RedeterminationList_Update.pdf___.YXAzOmNhcmVuZXRoZWFsdGg6YTpvOjc2NGY4YmZkMWYxZWVkOWYwYjc1Zjc1MWIyMDI0NGQ3OjY6OWNlYzo2NWZkZTdkMTg3NjQ5MGQ4YzBkYzQxNWU0YTAxOWQ1OTI2OTRhMTU2ZTMzOTgxODg2OTNhODEyOTYwNDQ1ZjYzOnA6VA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deadlines.</a></p><p>Medicaid redetermination will have impacts across the healthcare ecosystem. In addition to the risk of millions of current Medicaid members losing health care coverage, health plans that fail to retain their Medicaid members will face <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/www.lek.com/insights/hea/us/ei/phe-unwinding-impact-medicaid-redeterminations___.YXAzOmNhcmVuZXRoZWFsdGg6YTpvOjc2NGY4YmZkMWYxZWVkOWYwYjc1Zjc1MWIyMDI0NGQ3OjY6M2M1NDo0YjQxNmY5ZmM4MjIzZDZiZTcwNWFmNzM1MGEzMzhlMmIzMDQ2YjZmMjNmMTViYTc5ZThhN2Y1ZmMyODkzNTMwOnA6VA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial headwinds</a>. Identifying members who are at high risk of losing coverage and engaging in proactive outreach is critical to helping current Medicaid members retain their coverage and health care access. With Carenet&rsquo;s support, health plans can better serve their Medicaid members and navigate the complexities of redetermination so that more members can retain and take full advantage of their access to quality care. Medicaid redetermination is a minefield, and we have the resources to manage it.</p><h5 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Carenet_RedeterminationList_Update.pdf___.YXAzOmNhcmVuZXRoZWFsdGg6YTpvOjc2NGY4YmZkMWYxZWVkOWYwYjc1Zjc1MWIyMDI0NGQ3OjY6OWNlYzo2NWZkZTdkMTg3NjQ5MGQ4YzBkYzQxNWU0YTAxOWQ1OTI2OTRhMTU2ZTMzOTgxODg2OTNhODEyOTYwNDQ1ZjYzOnA6VA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contact Carenet and have us manage your redetermination program for Medicaid members.

							<p>The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is well underway and its latest phenom, ChatGPT, is taking the technology space by storm. What was once a go-to plot device of science fiction is now reality &ndash; people are communicating with machines and machines are responding and doing so with authority. As the world continues to size up the newest chatbot to make the scene, concerns on how ChatGPT might impact healthcare have already garnered significant coverage.</p><p>Just as the Dr. Google effect causes countless individuals to use search engines and other e-resources to generate self-diagnoses that can be as dire as they are inaccurate, ChatGPT is expected to play an increasing role over time in providing answers to medical questions. As care providers try to help people differentiate helpful online medical resources from misleading ones, it remains to be seen whether ChatGPT will quell or proliferate cyberchondria. And, at present, ChatGPT is only able to draw upon information that was documented through the end of 2021.</p><p><a href="https://medcitynews.com/2023/05/chatgpt-in-healthcare-the-promise-and-the-danger">Read the full article at MedCityNews</a></p><p><a href="https://medcitynews.com/2023/05/chatgpt-in-healthcare-the-promise-and-the-danger"><img class="alignnone wp-image-26824" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/logo-medcity-rockwell-optimized.svg" alt="medcitynews" width="250" height="42"></a></p>

							<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25991 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/patient-egagement-strategies-mental-health-banner.jpg" alt="mental health awareness" width="744" height="361"></p><p>This <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/03/fact-sheet-celebrating-mental-health-awareness-month-2023.html"><strong>Mental Health Awareness Month</strong></a>, we&rsquo;re raising awareness around engagement strategies and solutions that healthcare providers and payors can use to help patients and members living with mental or behavioral health conditions.</p><p>The impact on behavioral health in the U.S. has been exacerbated by the pandemic, economic anxiety related to inflation, rising consumer costs, and job insecurity. According to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/health/cnn-kff-mental-health-poll-wellness/index.html"><strong>2022 CNN poll</strong>,</a> 90% of respondents believe that America is experiencing a mental health crisis, with half of those surveyed saying that someone in their family has recently experienced a severe mental health episode. Additionally, 20% of respondents rated their own mental health as either &ldquo;fair&rdquo; or &ldquo;poor.&rdquo;</p><p>While demand for mental health services is growing, access to professional help is limited. The National Council for Economic Well-Being cites lack of access to care as a significant cause for the crisis, as more than 40% of Americans who reported seeking mental health care couldn&rsquo;t get it. Compounding the issue is the correlation between <strong><a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/how-does-mental-health-affect-physical-health#:~:text=Being%20in%20a%20good%20mental,Chronic%20diseases.">poor mental health and poor physical health</a></strong>, as depression has been linked to a number of chronic illnesses, including diabetes and heart disease.</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25972 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/forty-percent-not-receiving-care-1.jpg" alt="40% of americans seeking mental health care couldn't get it" width="800" height="267"></p><p>Healthcare providers and health plans have an opportunity to improve access to mental health services by implementing reactive and proactive patient and member engagement strategies for mental health.</p><h2 class="blog-subhead">Patient and Member Engagement Strategies for Behavioral and Mental Health</h2><p>Here are three behavioral health strategies that Carenet can help your organization implement to help the mental wellbeing of your patients.</p><h3 class="blog-subhead">Behavioral Health Crisis Program</h3><p>Behavioral health crisis support, in tandem with Nurse Triage and Advice Line, gives patients and members access to licensed behavioral health clinicians for immediate de-escalation and coordination of resources for longer-term solutions.</p><p>By including behavioral health crisis support in virtual clinics and nurse advice lines providers and health plans:</p><ul><li>Assess patient&rsquo;s immediate need for support</li><li>Guide patient to necessary support, resources and tools after assessment (including network providers, facilities and community resources)</li><li>Promote use of available health and wellness services</li><li>Evaluate patients for the presence of depression, anxiety, substance use concerns, interpersonal stress, and compliance with prescribed medications.</li><li>Coordinate care for emergent and urgent situations</li></ul><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25974 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/crisis-support-1.jpg" alt="behavior health crisis support options graphic" width="800" height="533"></p><p><strong>Support Patients at Home</strong></p><p>Visiting the doctor can be overwhelming, especially when discussing behavioral or emotional health. For patients to feel comfortable opening up, building trust through communication is key. Providing behavioral and mental health care via <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/"><strong>telehealth services, and 24/7 advice lines</strong></a> is a great way to improve access and overcome stigmas and fear around in-person care.</p><h3 class="blog-subhead">Proactive Patient Outreach</h3><p>Often, concern about a mental health diagnosis, as well as the associated assumed stigma, prevents people from seeking the emotional support services they need on their own. During Mental Health Awareness Month and beyond, providers and health plans can run outreach programs through social media, media, mail, phone, text and email to engage individuals in their mental health journeys. They can share important resources &ndash; like <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/tips-for-talking-with-your-health-care-provider"><strong>this article from the National Institute of Mental Health</strong></a>, which provide tips for talking with your healthcare provider about mental health. They can also invite individuals to schedule appointments, and to learn more about the resources available to them for behavioral and mental health. By <strong><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/what-we-do/engagement-services/">communicating with patients where they&rsquo;re most comfortable, and</a></strong> by opening the conversation, health organizations can help patients receive the services and support they need.</p><h2 class="blog-subhead">The Importance of Patient and Member Engagement Strategies for Behavioral and Mental Health</h2><p>Data from the American Psychological Association shows <strong>Americans are becoming more open about mental health.</strong> What&rsquo;s more, the majority of adults harbor positive associations with mental health treatment: <strong><a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2019/05/mental-health-survey">87% believe mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of</a> and <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2019/05/mental-health-survey">86% believe people struggling with mental health disorders can get better.</a></strong></p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25973 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/half-seek-treatment-1.jpg" alt="only half fo people with mental disorders receive treatment" width="800" height="267"></p><p>While Americans are growing more comfortable talking about mental health, it&rsquo;s still a pervasive issue. Tens of millions suffer from mental illnesses every year &mdash; an estimated <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/mental-health-disorder-statistics#:~:text=An%20estimated%2026%25%20of%20Americans,disorder%20in%20a%20given%20year."><strong>26% of adults over the age of 18 have a diagnosable condition.</strong></a> Throughout the pandemic, this number soared, with more people seeking treatment than ever before. However, estimates suggest only half of people with mental disorders receive treatment.</p><p>It&rsquo;s more important than ever that providers and health plans are available for and engage with their patients and members to ensure they have access to the behavioral and mental health care they need.</p>

							<p>Carenet&rsquo;s Christopher Rogers writes in Forbes Magazine about the vital importance of online self-scheduling in today&rsquo;s world.</p><p>As competition from major retailers and big tech companies continues to infiltrate the marketplace, <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/best-practices-in-patient-scheduling-for-healthcare-marketers/">online patient scheduling options</a> are now a must-have feature for hospitals and health systems. Rivalry among healthcare venues is fierce, as a growing number of healthcare consumers want the convenience of online patient scheduling. Health systems that do not offer online patient scheduling will not only be left behind but will be left out.</p><p>It&rsquo;s imperative for tech leaders in healthcare to harness patient activation momentum and keep patients engaged to ensure they are booking the medical appointments they need in a timely manner.

							<a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/how-to-promote-flu-and-rsv-vaccination-clinics-to-your-patients-and-members/">Healthcare consumers expect convenient,</a> high-touch, and technology-driven patient experiences more than ever&mdash;especially when it comes to flu shots. As more non-traditional healthcare providers enter the space, consumer demands are increasing exponentially. Health systems <em>can</em> create exceptional patient experiences with the right combination of communication and scheduling services.
<h5>5 Key Considerations to Meet Consumer Expectations for Flu Shot Clinic Operations:</h5>
1
<h5><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/how-to-promote-flu-and-rsv-vaccination-clinics-to-your-patients-and-members/">SMS Text Messages for Digital Flu Shot Promotion</a></h5>
Meet healthcare consumers where they are at. Share links to your flu shot clinic scheduling page, location of clinics, and information on the importance of vaccinations. Send to large audiences quickly and efficiently with <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/how-to-promote-flu-and-rsv-vaccination-clinics-to-your-patients-and-members/">healthcare broadcast messaging.</a> During the 2019-2020 flu season, 44% of patients who booked flu shot appointments online through Stericycle Online Scheduling did so on their mobile devices.
2
<h5><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/how-to-promote-flu-and-rsv-vaccination-clinics-to-your-patients-and-members/">Online Scheduling and Check-In for Flu Shot Appointments</a></h5>
Capture consumers before they leverage non-traditional walk-in clinics and provide the experience they expect with <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/how-to-promote-flu-and-rsv-vaccination-clinics-to-your-patients-and-members/">online scheduling.</a> Allow patients to schedule, confirm, and reschedule appointments online. Subscribe patients to future marketing communications expanding your patient lists for promoting future <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/how-to-promote-flu-and-rsv-vaccination-clinics-to-your-patients-and-members/">health and wellness campaigns.</a> &nbsp;During the 2019-2020 flu season, 30% of patients who booked flu shot appointments online through Stericycle Online Scheduling were new to the health system.
3
<h5>Send Flu Shot Reminders</h5>
Utilize <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/how-to-promote-flu-and-rsv-vaccination-clinics-to-your-patients-and-members/" rel="noopener">appointment reminders</a> so patients don&rsquo;t forget upcoming flu shot appointments. Share other important information via <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/how-to-promote-flu-and-rsv-vaccination-clinics-to-your-patients-and-members/" rel="noopener">email, text, and recorded voice reminders,</a> such as visit instructions, clinic operational hours, and weather closures. Natural language processing answers patients&rsquo; simple questions saving staff time and resources.
4
<h5>Outbound Phone Calls to High-Risk Patients</h5>
Remind high-risk patients why it&rsquo;s important to receive the flu shot. Answer any of their questions or concerns and schedule their appointments over the phone. Create HIPAA-compliant direct marketing campaigns based on patient demographics, medical history, physician, service line, location, and more.
5
<h5><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/how-to-promote-flu-and-rsv-vaccination-clinics-to-your-patients-and-members/">Multilingual Flu Shot Hotlines</a> for Patients and Staff</h5>
<a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/stericycle-health-and-wellness">Streamline inbound calls</a> from patients and staff with questions about the flu shot and how to book appointments. Ensure that your health system can answer questions in the patient&rsquo;s preferred language to drive access, action, and adherence.

Our Health &amp; Wellness Campaigns help you conduct personalized patient outreach for flu shot promotion, education, scheduling, and reminders without the extensive time commitment and extra resources from your staff. Health &amp; Wellness Campaigns simplify complex patient engagement and simultaneously increase revenue and satisfaction scores.

							<p>In recognition of National Nurses Week from May 6-12, 2023, health systems and organizations across the world are celebrating the hard work and dedication of our nurses. Nurses are the lynchpin that holds together the healthcare system, providing critical care for patients of all backgrounds and ages in settings from emergency rooms and urgent care facilities to schools and call centers.</p><p>At Carenet Health, National Nurses Week provides us an opportunity to show our gratitude for the hard work and diligence of our nurses who provide empathetic, <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ede72eec-c91b-43cb-a8fe-2dd7c30495d4.pdf">life-saving care through our 24/7 nurse advice and triage call line.</a></p><p><strong>Nursing Then and Now</strong></p><p>U.S. President Ronald Reagan first signed a proclamation designating May 6<sup>th</sup> as National Nurses Day in 1982. National Nurses Day was then expanded into National Nurses Week in 1990 by the American Nursing Association. Nurses Week ends every year on May 12<sup>th</sup>, the birthday of <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/www.britannica.com/biography/Florence-Nightingale___.YXAzOmNhcmVuZXRoZWFsdGg6YTpvOmNkMmNlMGNmMGQ5ZWFiNTExZmU3YmY5YmJmZjRmZjEzOjY6YTRkZDoxMTcwZTc2ODU4NzdmNGFlNzBmNDYyZGQ5ZjIzMmExMzRiMzU0ZjhmNzJhOGMxNTI2OGY5MTNkYWNhMjQ5NDcwOnA6VA">Florence Nightingale</a>. Widely considered the founder of modern nursing, she was a leading figure in the formalization of nursing education, establishing the Nightingale School of Nursing in 1860.</p><p><strong>What Makes our Carenet Nurses Special </strong></p><p>We recognize that nurses are a crucial resource for patients. With current trends including rising consumer demand for healthcare and the industry&rsquo;s move from a fee-for-service to a pay-for-performance model, the need for high quality, on demand nurse advice and symptom triage has never been more obvious. <strong>For this reason, we offer a 24/7 advice and triage call line staffed with experienced nurses.</strong> Having an experienced RN team available around the clock for consultation and triage has a range of benefits, from reducing unneeded ED visits and freeing up time for overburdened physician practices to improving patient safety, care access, and satisfaction. Using <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ede72eec-c91b-43cb-a8fe-2dd7c30495d4.pdf">Carenet&rsquo;s nurse advice and triage line elevates the quality and speed of service delivery while saving $162 million annually for telehealth clients in care cost avoidance. </a></p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-25672 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/nurses-week-statjpg.jpg" alt="To see just how effective, experienced, and compassionate Carenet nurses are, you only have to look at the data: our advice and triage line nurses have a 99% average patient satisfaction score. " width="700" height="200"></p><p>Carenet&rsquo;s nurses are hired with an average of 15 years of clinical experience and five years of experience in telehealth, are experienced in both pediatric and adult care, and receive intensive training on URAC standards, regulatory requirements, HIPAA, technology, and client-specific programs. <strong>In addition to their triage skills and medical knowledge, Carenet nurses are hired for their listening skills and empathy.</strong> <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">Our nurses become trusted resources for patients, quickly addressing issues and steering patients to the most appropriate care setting.</a></p><p>&ldquo;I would not have gone to the hospital if the nurse had not told me to,&rdquo; said one patient who was told by a Carenet nurse to go to the emergency department after experiencing difficulty breathing. &ldquo;They found blood clots in both my lungs when I went to the ED.&rdquo;</p><p>Other patients shared similar stories reflecting the life-saving impact of Carenet&rsquo;s nurses: &ldquo;I went to the emergency room, and it&rsquo;s a good thing I did,&rdquo; said a patient who was diagnosed with liver cancer in the ED after calling Carenet&rsquo;s nurse advice line with abdominal pain. &ldquo;It was very good I got here when I did&hellip;I&rsquo;m really grateful. The nurse saved my life&hellip;It would have been terrible if I had not gone into the ED. This is the second time you&rsquo;ve saved my life.&rdquo;<strong style="text-align: var(--text-align);">&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic, economic downturn, and changing technology and consumer demand have contributed to increasing amounts of burnout and turnover among nurses, <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/carenethealthcare.com/consumerism-inflation-innovation-predictions-in-2023-healthcare-landscape/___.YXAzOmNhcmVuZXRoZWFsdGg6YTpvOmNkMmNlMGNmMGQ5ZWFiNTExZmU3YmY5YmJmZjRmZjEzOjY6MDIwNTpmOGMyMGRjZjdhNGU5NjE0OTNjNjQwZGI2NzVmNjQ0ODFlNjJhM2QyZjIwMGJhYjIxNTQ2OGNmY2VkYTZlZGQ5OnA6VA">leading to significant workforce shortages</a>. Due to these challenges and an aging nursing workforce preparing for retirement, the <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/www.aha.org/fact-sheets/2021-05-26-fact-sheet-strengthening-health-care-workforce___.YXAzOmNhcmVuZXRoZWFsdGg6YTpvOmNkMmNlMGNmMGQ5ZWFiNTExZmU3YmY5YmJmZjRmZjEzOjY6YWUxNDphNzdhNjJiNTM1NGE2YzIyMjYzOGVkYjgwMjViYjMyY2M0NDViOTMxYzUxNTNiZTVlMzQyZWE5ZjY0ZWQ2OWY4OnA6VA">American Hospital Association</a> predicts that the U.S. will need to hire 200,000 registered nurses (RNs) per year to avoid significant shortages. With these challenges in mind, there&rsquo;s all the more reason to show appreciation for nurses during Nurses Week and beyond.</p><p>Of course, supporting nurses and fostering a healthy nursing workforce should be a year-round initiative for hospitals and health systems. Healthcare organizations support emotional wellness and reduce burnout and turnover among nurses during Nurses Week and beyond through company policies, professional development opportunities, and more:</p><ul><li><strong>Shared decision making</strong>: Nurses are on the frontlines of healthcare, providing critical care to patients day-in and day-out. They offer a unique perspective when it comes to making organizational decisions such as new technology investments or policy changes. Not only can including nurses in decision-making improve engagement and reduce turnover, it can have a positive impact on patient care and outcomes as well, as nurses are experts among healthcare professionals on patient needs.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Wellness resources:</strong> Many nurses may experience burnout at some point in their career due to long hours and exposure to difficult emotional situations. To help keep nurses emotionally healthy and prevent burnout, healthcare organizations should offer mental health resources and group events that provide opportunities for nurses to unwind and connect over shared experiences.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Staffing and time-off policies</strong>: Offering nurses enough paid time off is critical to reducing burnout and turnover and ensuring nurses are at their best so that patient care quality doesn&rsquo;t suffer. In addition to offering time off, healthcare organizations should do their best to promote healthy work-life balance through manageable work hours and workload. Staffing appropriately also helps manage workload for those in the trenches.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Professional development opportunities: </strong>Opportunities for professional development and continued education can help keep nurses engaged and ensure patient care is of the highest quality and informed by all the latest research and methods. Helping nurses grow in their careers through seminars, certification programs, and more is a great way to show that you care and are invested in their futures.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Leadership mentoring: </strong>Having the support of a senior nurse who has years of experience on the frontlines of healthcare under their belt can be a gamechanger. Experienced nurses can be a resource for more junior nurses in many areas, providing emotional support, encouragement, and time-tested advice.<strong style="text-align: var(--text-align);">&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Showing Appreciation During Nurses Week and Beyond</strong></p><p>Nurses Week provides a great opportunity for healthcare organizations and the community to show gratitude and appreciation for all that nurses do. By recognizing nurses&rsquo; impact, healthcare organizations can increase staff morale and potentially improve recruitment and retention of nurses.</p><p><b style="color: #242424; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 14.6667px;">Happy Nurses Week to All the Amazing Nurses at Carenet!</b></p><p>Contact us to learn more about Carenet Health&rsquo;s 24/7 Nurse Advice and Triage line.<br><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">Telehealth Solutions | Carenet Health (carenethealthcare.com)</a></p>

							<p><strong><em>New internship program at three sites signals Carenet&rsquo;s dedication to deepening its presence in the Philippines </em></strong></p><p><strong>SAN ANTONIO, Texas, (May 2, 2023) &mdash; </strong><a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/carenethealthcare.com/___.YXAzOmNhcmVuZXRoZWFsdGg6YTpvOmY3Y2EwYmY1OTAyYzMxZjA3YTNmMzlkNzEzMzE0NTBkOjY6OGE5Mzo2NjMzNzM4ZjY3MDhhNzk0ZmQ5NTMzODk3NjBiZmZmY2Q5ZWQ4YzgyY2UxOTE5NTZiMjljMzMyMmU3MmIyZTJhOnA6VA">Carenet Health</a>, a leading provider of 24/7 and on-demand patient engagement solutions, announced today that it has partnered with Far Eastern University (FEU) Alabang, FEU Diliman, and FEU Institute of Technology, all private universities in Manila, Philippines, to establish a robust internship program to create opportunities for their students particularly those with specializations in Business, Web and Mobile Application, Data Science, and Business Analytics. The data labeling internship program will allow participating students to foster beneficial career and life skills while providing a valuable service to Carenet&rsquo;s <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/carenethealthcare.com/what-we-do/cx-analytics/___.YXAzOmNhcmVuZXRoZWFsdGg6YTpvOmY3Y2EwYmY1OTAyYzMxZjA3YTNmMzlkNzEzMzE0NTBkOjY6ZGQwNTozODExODFhYjM5OGU4ZmY3OTY5NTI5MTVhMGRmMTRkZGViYjcyMzcxOTVjZTY5ZGM5MjMxNjFkZDRlODU0NDk3OnA6VA">CX Analytics Group</a>, which works to identify points of friction in the healthcare consumer service journey experience.</p><p>&ldquo;Carenet Health&rsquo;s work with these three programs at Far Eastern University is demonstrative of our deepening presence in the Philippines and our dedication to developing key relationships there, as we are currently growing our number of Filipino employees based out of the country, in addition to our interns,&rdquo; said Christopher Rogers, Carenet&rsquo;s chief operating officer.</p><p>The primary objective of the data-labeling internship is for students to work on projects that aid in the improvement of key industry performance indicators such as consumer satisfaction, process and policy compliance, and machine learning capabilities. The interns are specializing in business analytics or web/mobile applications as part of Carenet Health&rsquo;s CX Analytics Group, which aims to deliver clear visibility into engagement touchpoints before, during, and after customer service interactions. The current cohorts are comprised of five interns, which can generate over 100,000 data labels during their 10-week internship. Thus far, the program has had 10 interns and plans to scale the program&rsquo;s cohorts to between 30 and 50 interns.</p><p>&ldquo;As a preferred partner , Carenet Health has given our students invaluable access to an internship program where they can learn skills that will allow them to succeed in the workforce upon graduation,&rdquo; said Carmencita C. Suarez, director of the Industry Academe, Linkage, Alumni, and Placement (IALAP) at FEU Institute of Technology. &ldquo;Students gain important experience working for an American company, a critical professional advantage as they develop their skills and enter the workforce.&rdquo;</p><p>Once student cohorts are selected, Carenet provides interns with the necessary equipment to work from home, headsets, and laptops. Interns receive training in Microsoft Excel, crucial communication and presentation skills, and the fundamentals of data analysis. Carenet also helps students develop career skills such as networking by requiring them to create LinkedIn pages, attend workshops for writing effective cover letters, and to practice job interview skills.</p><p>&ldquo;Working with Carenet Health in their data-labeling internship program has opened my eyes to the world of healthcare and consumer engagement,&rdquo; said Gregorio I. Manio V, a current data labeling intern for Carenet&rsquo;s CX Analytics group. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m learning integral skills in the field of business analytics while gaining strong workforce experience.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>About Carenet Health</strong></p><p>Carenet Health is the industry&rsquo;s leading healthcare consumer engagement company, providing member and patient engagement, clinical support, virtual care, online scheduling, and advocacy solutions for providers, payers, and partners.

							<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25565 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hra-success-custom-plans.jpg" alt="mother and son playing" width="744" height="361"></p><p>As states and managed care organizations (MCOs) contend with the end of Medicaid&rsquo;s continuous enrollment period, now is a critical time for health plans to ensure they are optimizing their Medicaid and Medicare health risk assessment (HRA) processes. To provide beneficiaries with cost-effective, quality care, health plans should routinely refine their efforts to comply with the requirements of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to maintain member information that&rsquo;s accurate, up-to-date, and complete.</p><p>Low completion rates, engagement strategies that lack personalization, relevance, and choice, as well as outdated outreach tactics are all factors that can drive substandard HRA data. By following best practices and deploying innovative approaches to collecting information, organizations can achieve robust response metrics to effectively evaluate members&rsquo; health risks. Carenet has a deep understanding of CMS regulations and extensive experience reaching out to and connecting with the vulnerable Medicaid and Medicare populations.</p><p>When engaging with individuals about completing their assessment, it&rsquo;s important to identify which form of communication they prefer such as phone calls, emails, or texts. By giving members communication options to choose from, health plans can foster <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/medicaid-member-engagement-strategies-that-work">Medicare and Medicaid patient engagement,</a> increase response rates, and obtain more-complete patient information. To maximize the effectiveness of HRA campaigns, organizations should also test and analyze their outreach communications strategy to determine what works well and what does not, and then implement changes to improve outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>Other proactive steps include addressing opportunities for health and wellness intervention during (not after) the HRA process, addressing foreign language needs, follow-up strategies for non-participants, and having resources in place to integrate collected data into member profiles as quickly as possible. These are just some of the steps that are critical to achieving the best HRA process possible &ndash; for organizations that want to assess how their program measures up, <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/carenethealthcare.com/hra-evaluation-tool/___.YXAzOmNhcmVuZXRoZWFsdGg6YTpvOjkzYTczODg5N2EyNDkxMDc0NDMxZDIyOWNjMGVhNzU3OjY6NWNjMzowMjY5ZjAxNjE2ZmEzYzdhMTcwNGE5N2JmODQ2N2Q1MWRlYTAyYTdlM2EzOWU1MjQ1MzA4OTZmMGMyMjg5NmNjOnA6VA">check out Carenet&rsquo;s online HRA evaluation tool.</a></p><h5><strong>Innovative and Customized Plans Achieve Exceptional Results&nbsp; </strong></h5><p>For example, a not-for-profit health plan that was using conventional direct mail to conduct Medicaid HRA surveys <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/carenethealthcare.com/strategic-engagement-solution-health-risk-assessment-success-story/___.YXAzOmNhcmVuZXRoZWFsdGg6YTpvOjkzYTczODg5N2EyNDkxMDc0NDMxZDIyOWNjMGVhNzU3OjY6MDMxMDpkMGIzNTUwZTA0MDc3NWY0YTEzODIzNmMyZGEzYzg4NzljMjZlNzFmOWVmN2E5MDI3MGZhMDVkOTNlOTU4OWQ3OnA6VA">partnered with Carenet to remedy its exceedingly low response rates</a>. As many of its members did not reside at the address on record, the plan was unable to evaluate the health risk of a high percentage of its members and identify those with complex and costly healthcare needs, which compromised its clinical and financial outcomes.</p><p>Operating within a tight deadline, Carenet designed a customized plan to overcome the organization&rsquo;s Medicaid population obstacles that included insecure housing, invalid contact information, language barriers, and low health literacy. The plan addressed the need to conduct consistent HRA survey collection and follow-up communication that was personalized and focused on each individual&rsquo;s needs and unique circumstances. Every step of the program was designed to meet agency compliance and achieve the goal of increasing completion rates, improving the plan&rsquo;s risk stratification, and identifying gaps in care.</p><p>The strategy, which exceeded its reach rate goal, achieved a 67% HRA completion rate within the 60-day deadline. When the process was complete, many members also expressed gratitude for the compassion they were shown through the personal interactions they had with the agents who served them.</p><p>In a similar partnership with another not-for-profit health plan, Carenet devised a <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/carenethealthcare.com/hra-outreach-achieves-56-percent-completion-rate-among-dual-eligibles/___.YXAzOmNhcmVuZXRoZWFsdGg6YTpvOjkzYTczODg5N2EyNDkxMDc0NDMxZDIyOWNjMGVhNzU3OjY6ZDc0Zjo4NmY0NWEyZmEzNzBlM2Y4ZDBkYmY2MmUwYjA2ZTRjNWJiODkwZGMzMWZmMmMwMzAzYzQ1MTlkMTEwZGMxODNjOnA6VA">customized outreach strategy to boost HRA completion rates</a> for the plan&rsquo;s dual-eligible members, a particularly difficult population to engage. CMS selected the health plan to deploy a dual-eligible demonstration project and the plan tapped Carenet to leverage its expertise to test a more effective outreach model. In addition to increasing HRA completion rates, CMS wanted the plan to elevate care quality and reduce costs among its high-, medium- and low-risk members, and identify as quickly as possible those members requiring case management interventions.</p><p>For the project, CMS required that the outreach be conducted by registered nurses and not non-clinical personnel. Carenet deployed a team chosen from its in-house workforce of nurses who are experts at engaging and educating members in order to guide the beneficiaries through the HRA process, respond to clinical questions, and initiate case management when needed. Carenet&rsquo;s solution also included integration with the health plan&rsquo;s customer relationship management (CRM) system and scripting tool.</p><p>The customized plan achieved a 56% HRA completion rate and the member data that was captured met the goals of the CMS demonstration project &ndash; the enrollment of high-risk members into case management programs, and the implementation of personalized care plans.</p><p>As health plans work in the weeks and months ahead to obtain and document updated member information during the Medicaid redetermination process, Carenet is available to provide innovative, leading-edge solutions with proven results.</p><p>Learn more about how Carenet Health can support your organization through the <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/carenethealthcare.com/prepare-for-2023-medicaid-redeterminations/___.YXAzOmNhcmVuZXRoZWFsdGg6YTpvOjkzYTczODg5N2EyNDkxMDc0NDMxZDIyOWNjMGVhNzU3OjY6MmM1MTpiZTAyNjk3NzExZGVkZmVmMjYxN2RhZGNmMGRjNjI3MTU0YTVkNWVkMWU3MGE0MjAxZThkZmNkOTI1NGIzNzY1OnA6VA">Medicaid redetermination process</a> and beyond and contact us today.</p>

As beneficiaries prepare for Medicaid&rsquo;s redetermination process following the official end of the public health emergency (PHE) in May, they will need help from their plan administrators to understand and navigate the complexities the transition will present.</p><p>Even before the PHE, connecting and engaging with Medicaid enrollees and prompting them to action presented challenges due to issues such as inaccurate contact information, language barriers, childcare and transportation difficulties, lack of reliable internet access, and other social determinants of health.</p><p><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Carenet_RedeterminationList_Update.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-25741 size-full" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/download-redetermination-dates.jpg" alt="download our list of redetmination dates" width="740" height="205"></a></p><p>Pandemic-related measures enacted by Congress in 2020 required Medicaid programs to maintain member enrollments through the end of the PHE in exchange for increased valuable federal funding. As a result, total Medicaid enrollment during this time grew to more than 90 million. But as many as 14 million people could lose Medicaid coverage, according to a study by the <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/10-things-to-know-about-the-unwinding-of-the-medicaid-continuous-enrollment-provision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, threatening the health and wellbeing of the country&rsquo;s most vulnerable populations.</p><p>To retain Medicaid members, state Medicaid programs and Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) must have the <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/succeeding-in-the-ever-changing-medicaid-landscape/">resources</a> to elevate member engagement and optimize health outcomes.</p><h4>Delivering Better Outcomes for the Medicaid Population</h4><p>Supportive Medicaid programs can deliver better health outcomes by taking a specialized approach to member engagement and activation that focuses on overcoming the barriers that block members from getting the care they need. Although the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 helped address many of the challenges related to serving the Medicaid patient population, there is still more work to be done to ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/medicaid-member-engagement-strategies-that-work">Medicaid engagement programs</a> should include behavioral health crisis support that helps stabilize mental health episodes by providing people with immediate assistance to reduce potentially unnecessary ED visits. In 2021, Carenet designed a 24-hour <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/one-stop-behavioral-health-crisis-support-delivers-95-ed-diversion/">specialty support hotline</a> for a 15-state health plan that wanted to offer its Medicaid and Medicare Advantage members an improved behavioral health support experience. Following implementation, the crisis support solution helped 95% of participating members avoid expensive behavioral health-related ED care and gave all participants immediate access to de-escalation resources.</p><p>Additional approaches to effectively <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/who-we-serve/health-plans/medicaid/">serve and engage the Medicaid population</a><u> </u>include addressing challenges such as fluctuations in membership growth, a shortage of providers and access to clinics, healthcare literacy issues, non-urgent emergency department (ED) visits, limited member support, continual regulatory changes, and financial constraints. Carenet, which supports over 22 million Medicaid lives through more than 1,000 programs, delivers a specialized engagement approach to serve the complexities of the Medicaid population. This includes designing a comprehensive contact plan, increasing proactive outreach, promoting access to on-demand telehealth care, providing around-the-clock member support, and leveraging progressive technology and actionable data.</p><h4>By using the Carenet Health approach, you can:</h4><ul><li>Can more easily identify and engage with high-cost, high-need members with chronic and under-treated conditions</li><li>Ensure routine patient-physician interaction and relationship-building by overcoming barriers to care</li><li>Drive appropriate resource use to reduce unnecessary and or duplicate care</li><li>Control costs by reducing avoidable readmissions</li><li>Support care compliance by empowering members to become active participants in their care</li><li>Elevate member retention to reduce gaps in care and coverage</li></ul><p>Other ways to serve the Medicaid population and promote health equity are through <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/what-we-do/advocacy-solutions/">health advocacy services</a> and disease management support. These services, which provide individuals with information on care options, scheduling, follow-up support, education, and outreach for high-risk, high-cost members, help ensure members get the treatment they need to achieve the best outcomes possible. For those who have or are at risk for developing chronic conditions like hypertension, disease management support <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/980466" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been found to play an important role</a> in helping patients control their blood pressure.</p><p>Additionally, services such as <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">telehealth nurse triage/advice lines and virtual clinics</a> provide individuals with support options that are less expensive than in-person doctor appointments or ED visits. It&rsquo;s important that Medicaid programs promote the existence of available virtual care options, as <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/only-1-10-patients-use-telehealth-as-lack-awareness-hinders-adoption-j-d-power-survey-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies have shown</a> that a high percentage of healthcare consumers are not aware of these resources.</p><h4>Support for Challenges that Lie Ahead</h4><p>Customized strategies allow state Medicaid programs and Medicaid MCOs to better serve their current members and create new paths to expand affordable healthcare to the nation&rsquo;s most vulnerable individuals. At this critical moment, nearly six decades after the Social Security Act was signed into law, the unwinding of the PHE and the complexities of redetermination will present many challenges for Medicaid members, the workforce that supports them, and healthcare providers throughout the country. Don&rsquo;t let your members get lost in the shuffle.</p><p>Learn more about how Carenet Health can support your organization through the <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/prepare-for-2023-medicaid-redeterminations/">Medicaid redetermination process</a> and beyond, and contact us today.

Although updates made by CMS in past years were meant to better account for the member experience, the revised analytics driven by the proposed changes have the potential to affect patient adherence to treatment plans and could adversely impact health outcomes.<br><br><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/special-resource-collection-medicare-advantage-cms-stars-program">Click here</a> to explore Carenet&rsquo;s Medicare Advantage content hub.</p><p>The potential change was announced in December 2022 in a published document entitled <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/12/27/2022-26956/medicare-program-contract-year-2024-policy-and-technical-changes-to-the-medicare-advantage-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contract Year 2024 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage Program</a>. With this, CMS is proposing to reduce the weight of patient experience/complaints for its Star Ratings in 2026. CMS stated that after &ldquo;taking into consideration additional stakeholder feedback&hellip; we believe these measures currently receive an undue weight in the Star Ratings program.&rdquo;</p><p>The proposed ruling also stated that the changes &ldquo;will focus provider attention, reduce provider burden&hellip; and allow for cross-comparisons across quality and value-based care programs, to better understand what drives quality and equity improvement and what does not.&rdquo;</p><p>There is already enough evidence to determine a weight of 1.5 for the Patient Experience/Complaints and Access measure has a negative impact on patients. It disincentivizes health plans from investing in measures designed to <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/how-to-improve-star-ratings-by-enhancing-member-experience-via-human-observation/">improve the patient experience</a> and take meaningful steps to respond to their direct feedback.</p><p>In this sense, lowering the weight from 4 back to 2 seems like a step in the wrong direction. Some thought leaders argue that with this move, CMS is decreasing the likelihood that plans will take action against the real-life challenges that patients face when accessing and benefiting from care. It also reduces financial compensation for those who do take steps to improve a patient&rsquo;s healthcare experience, despite the fact that <a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/cahps/quality-improvement/improvement-guide/2-why-improve/index.html#:~:text=Patients%20with%20better%20care%20experiences%20often%20have%20better,health%20outcomes%20a%20year%20after%20discharge.%2010%2C%2011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these actions have been shown to improve outcomes and reduce overall cost</a>.</p><p><strong>Looking Back at Previous Changes to the Star Ratings</strong></p><p>When the Star Ratings program first introduced weights to its measures in 2012, Patient Experience and Access had a weight of 1.5, compared to a weight of 3 for Clinical Outcomes and 1 for Processes.</p><p>At the time, Patient Experience and Access (now termed Patient Experience/Complaints and Access) was one of the most neglected measures. Because it only affected around 30% of the total Star ratings, it was considered too difficult for plans to raise their score via improvements to factors that affected member experience, such as care coordination and access.</p><p>Recognizing this issue, CMS made a change in 2018 that brought the weight of patient experience measures from 1.5 up to 2. Now the patient&rsquo;s experience of care accounted for closer to 40% of the total Star Ratings, &ldquo;given the importance of hearing the perspectives and voice of patients in times of need,&rdquo; according to CMS. Many health plans perceived that the weight of this measure might have been on track to increase even further.</p><p>With a greater Star Ratings emphasis on patient satisfaction, health plans began to focus on improvements to the patient experience like never before. New departments dedicated to this area were set up, new tools and analytics were identified and leveraged, and a variety of actionable steps were taken towards improving the aspects of care that matter to patients.</p><p>The change in the overall healthcare landscape was so impactful that in 2020 CMS decided the weight of Patient Experience/Complaints and Access would be doubled, from 2 to 4, making it virtually impossible for any plans to avoid addressing patient experience issues within their organization.</p><p>This change would be negated by the recently proposed ruling, which suggests the weight be dropped back down to 2.</p><p><strong>Carenet Reaffirms its Commitment to Fostering Health Equity and Quality Care for All </strong></p><p>Given these potential setbacks to the quality of the Medicare system, Carenet Health has reaffirmed its commitment to delivering advancements in healthcare consumer engagement that achieve the highest standard of care. Responding to the needs of healthcare consumers and supporting them in their patient journey is critical to fostering a more equitable health system in which quality care is available for all.<br>As the industry leader in healthcare consumer engagement, Carenet is a pioneer of programs and platforms designed to increase access to care, and bolster patient and member support.</p><p><a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/special-resource-collection-medicare-advantage-cms-stars-program/">Carenet provides a wide range of resources for Medicare Advantage plans</a> focused on improving or maintaining CMS Star program ratings.

							<p>Although COVID-19&rsquo;s prevalence and lethality has dropped around the country, the winding down of the pandemic will have far-reaching repercussions for the healthcare industry. In 2020, Congress enacted measures in response to the pandemic that included a requirement that &ndash; in exchange for increased federal funding &ndash; Medicaid programs would maintain its members&rsquo; enrollments through the end of the month in which the public health emergency (PHE) was declared over.</p><p>With the continuous enrollment period now scheduled to end on March 31, 2023, the enhanced federal funding of Medicaid will phase down through December 2023.</p><p><strong>Concerns for Medicaid Patients </strong></p><p>The continuous enrollment period substantially increased the number of Medicaid recipients. Total enrollment grew to <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/10-things-to-know-about-the-unwinding-of-the-medicaid-continuous-enrollment-provision/">90.9 million in September 2022</a>, which was an increase of 19.8 million from February 2020. States were prevented from disenrolling people from coverage, so more people have maintained insurance through the pandemic.</p><p>What to know about disenrollment:</p><ul><li>Beginning in April, states can reinitiate the Medicaid disenrollment process.</li><li>Between 5.3 million and 14.2 million people will lose Medicaid coverage during the unwinding period.</li><li>As many as 15 million beneficiaries could be disenrolled, but the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimates <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/404a7572048090ec1259d216f3fd617e/aspe-end-mcaid-continuous-coverage_IB.pdf">8 million people will still be eligible</a> for coverage.</li><li>Along with people who moved during the pandemic, beneficiaries with limited English proficiency and people with disabilities are at a higher risk of losing coverage.</li></ul><p>Beneficiaries in some states may not have had direct contact with Medicaid in the three years since their enrollment, and <a href="https://healthpayerintelligence.com/features/how-states-can-prepare-for-2023-medicaid-redeterminations">continuous coverage protections</a> mean some states have lapsed in regular communication with enrollees.</p><p>Prior to COVID-19, temporary loss of Medicaid coverage was common, but the continuous enrollment mandate paused churn. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires states to complete administrative renewals by verifying continued eligibility &ndash; known as ex parte processes &ndash; through government data sources before sending renewal forms or requestion documentation from a beneficiary. This reduces the administrative burden on recipients to maintain their coverage. However, some states suspended renewals during the continuous enrollment period, and many are lagging in completing renewals with ex parte processes, according to KFF.</p><p><strong>Priorities Ahead of Redetermination</strong></p><p>After the PHE ends on May 11 and states begin the process of redetermining eligibility for Medicaid recipients, staffing capacity may be overwhelmed. Because of the daunting scope of the project ahead, state Medicaid agencies cannot expect to handle redetermination on their own. Communicating with beneficiaries will be a massive undertaking that will require additional Medicaid stakeholders, such as managed care plans, healthcare providers, and consumer advocates.</p><p>What to do before redetermination:</p><ul><li>Monitor performance data: This will ensure agency goals are being met, to keep the process clear to enrollees, and to track the number of people disenrolled for reasons other than eligibility.</li><li>Update mailing addresses: The pandemic pushed many people out of urban areas. Address changes could cause Medicaid recipients to miss being notified of their upcoming disenrollment.</li><li>Contact beneficiaries: States are required to maintain up-to-date contact information for recipients and must attempt to contact enrollees before they lose coverage.</li></ul><p>Due to the immense process of redetermination, call centers will be critical touchpoints for Medicaid beneficiaries. Carenet Health is well-positioned to assist during the disenrollment period through <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/medicaid-member-engagement-strategies-that-work">member engagement</a> to ensure eligible enrollees maintain their coverage.</p><p>By utilizing multichannel support through outbound emails, texts, calls, and fielding inbound inquiries from disenrolled recipients who need to know how to reapply for coverage, Carenet&rsquo;s wide range of solutions can help navigate the transition that lies ahead.</p><p>To talk to an expert about how Carenet Health can support your organization through its Medicaid redetermination, fill out the form below.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>As the healthcare industry faces significant headwinds in 2023, Carenet Health has identified seven predictions related to key trends that will shape the healthcare landscape in the year ahead. Based on our&nbsp;<a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://carenethealthcare.com/carenet-healths-2023-healthcare-consumer-engagement-forecast-free-to-download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 Healthcare Consumer Engagement Forecast</a>, this two-part blog will highlight strategies that payers and providers can focus on as inflation and other challenges threaten the bottom line.&nbsp;</p><p>Part 1 will explore inflationary pressures that will continue to impact healthcare consumers and organizations, the need for innovative solutions to contend with labor shortages, and the growing importance of consumerism in the year ahead and beyond.&nbsp;</p><h3>1. Inflation Will Continue to Impact the Healthcare Space</h3><p>Economic uncertainty brings with it a range of emotions for consumers &ndash; confusion, anxiety, and fear &ndash;as no one knows if the situation is going to improve or deteriorate. As consumers become more focused on all expenditures, including health costs, the deferred care crisis will be exacerbated by fears of the financial unknown. &nbsp;</p><p>For payers and providers, inflation equates to threats to the bottom line, and the negative impact in 2022 was nothing short of staggering. Last year, U.S. hospitals suffered billions of dollars in losses and some estimates report that more than two-thirds of hospitals had negative margins.</p><p>There appears to be no relief in sight, at least for the near-term. Fitch Ratings is projecting &ldquo;a very bumpy 2023&rdquo; for the hospital industry. Many healthcare leaders are bracing for a continued decline in operating margins, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/gathering-storm" rel="noopener">hospital closures and bankruptcies</a>&nbsp;loom on the horizon. Additionally, according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/inflation-tops-list-of-worries-for-ceos-survey-says.html" rel="noopener">survey conducted by the Conference Board</a>, more than half of healthcare CEOs believe inflationary pressures will last until mid-2023 or beyond. &nbsp;</p><p>To fight back against inflation and continue serving the needs of consumers, payers and providers can prioritize the consumer experience by fostering trust with patients and members. This leads to better retention, higher feedback scores, and better health outcomes.<br>Other suggestions include:</p><ul><li>Addressing system inefficiencies by fortifying rural health capacity, streamlining supply chains, and developing talent pipelines</li><li>Providing training opportunities for overtaxed workforces to build valuable new skills and increase retention</li><li>Optimizing digital tools and technology to make options like ambulatory surgery centers and home healthcare more accessible</li></ul><h3>2. Innovative Solutions Will Be Needed to Address the Labor Shortage&nbsp;</h3><p>Fueled by an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/the-exodus-of-american-healthcare-workers-and-what-comes/427611">exodus of clinicians, nurses, and support staff</a>&nbsp;following the height of the pandemic, the labor shortage in healthcare has reached acute levels. For example, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/surveyed-nurses-consider-leaving-direct-patient-care-at-elevated-rates">2022 survey conducted by McKinsey &amp; Company</a>&nbsp;found that 29% of responding registered nurses expect to leave their current role in direct patient care, with many indicating they intend to leave the workforce entirely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Although its impact on staffing shortages was significant, the pandemic isn&rsquo;t entirely to blame. Prior to 2020,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.modernhealthcare.com/labor/addressing-public-health-crisis-healthcare-worker-burnout">burnout was already taking a toll</a>&nbsp;on doctors and nurses. Added to this, administrative staffers are contending with noncompetitive wages, long work hours, and a perceived lack of advancement opportunities, placing further strain on the workforce.</p><p>Clinicians are also stressing the need for a complete transformation of the care model and&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/healthcare-workforce-shortage-solutions.html">more investment in technology</a>&nbsp;to help increase their time spent on patient care.</p><p>Resolving the labor shortage will require new ways of looking at the traditional staffing model, including:</p><ul><li>Hiring highly skilled offshore nurses and clinicians at advantageous price points</li><li>Finding technical solutions that help stretch the workforce, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aha.org/aha-center-health-innovation-market-scan/2022-06-28-how-some-hospitals-are-grappling-workforce">&ldquo;tele-sitting&rdquo; programs</a>&nbsp;that use bedside cameras and speakers to assist nurses virtually</li><li>Developing&nbsp;<a href="https://avenuem.ucdavis.edu/news/avenuem-creates-path-success">pathway programs</a>&nbsp;from schools into health systems that start at the community college level and provide a road to employment, helping fill care gaps in rural areas</li><li>Creating apprenticeship programs that address skill and talent gaps for medical assistants</li><li>Identifying medical&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/01/26/the-gig-economy-is-trying-to-solve-health-cares-burnout-crisis">gig economy platforms</a>, where facilities can find traveling nurses to provide temporary staffing help in times of need</li></ul><h3>3. Consumerism Will Play an Increasingly Important Role &nbsp;</h3><p>As plans and providers typically assert control and dictate the terms, patients are often faced with limited options when it comes to how they are served. Simply put, the approach taken by providers and payers may be construed as &ldquo;My way or the highway.&rdquo; As the landscape across the healthcare continuum evolves, consumerism and customer experience need to be prioritized.&nbsp;</p><p>The patient journey roadmap is changing, and consumers today expect something better than the old way of doing business. They want&nbsp;<a href="https://medcitynews.com/2022/10/patients-as-savvy-consumers-demand-for-personalized-care-drives-todays-digital-healthcare-services-market/" rel="noopener">personalized customer service</a>, they want to be appreciated, and they want transparency from providers and payers. As healthcare consumer expectations continue to rise and&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.perficient.com/2020/12/01/how-u-s-demographic-trends-are-reshaping-healthcare-now-and-forever-and-why-that-matters/" rel="noopener">demographics change</a>, consumerism has become more important than ever.</p><p>Being served as a consumer, healthcare costs, quality of care, and convenient access to treatment are all top-of-mind for patients and plan members today. And, with the increasing presence of nontraditional players, including&nbsp;<a href="https://thehealthcaretechnologyreport.com/the-top-100-healthcare-technology-companies-of-2022/" rel="noopener">health-tech startups</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/saibala/2022/02/16/walmart-may-soon-become-the-largest-primary-care-provider-in-the-country/?sh=6731423a73be" rel="noopener">major retailers</a>, consumer-focused engagement strategies and efficiency-boosting technical tools will be critical.</p><p>Another key aspect of consumerism is understanding the preferences of millennials, those born between the early 80s and mid-90s. For example, when it comes to primary care &ndash; once a foundation of the industry &ndash; many millennials don&rsquo;t prioritize scheduling doctor appointments regularly and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.texmed.org/Template.aspx?id=60482" rel="noopener">don&rsquo;t recognize the value of the primary care model</a>. One study revealed that more than one-third of people aged 25 to 34 said they&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/digital-marketing/37-of-millennials-don-t-trust-their-providers-study-shows.html" rel="noopener">don&rsquo;t trust their providers</a>.</p><p>In order to unlock the potential for true healthcare consumerism, the industry will need to address consumers&rsquo; mistrust as it relates to channels, reliability, and credibility as well as making access to care simpler, personalized, and more convenient.</p><p>Stay tuned for the second part of this blog, in which we will highlight four more trends that will play a significant role in shaping the healthcare space in the weeks and months ahead.</p><p>Follow along on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/carenet-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;for the latest news about Carenet Health.</p><p><a role="button" href="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Carenet_Health_2023_Engagement_Forcast_v2-3.pdf"><b style="color: #4a4a4a;">&mdash;</b></a></p><p><strong>ABOUT CARENET HEALTH</strong></p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to talk more about&nbsp;<a href="/a-turning-point-in-the-complex-intersection-of-consumer-needs-changing-care-access-and-advocacy/">advocacy and navigation programs</a>&nbsp;and how they can address network leakage and improve Star ratings,&nbsp;<a href="/contact/">contact us today</a>.

							<p>Choosing Medicare coverage is a high-stakes game for older Americans right now. With inflation battering retirees&rsquo; budgets, those aging into Medicare eligibility might be even more discerning about what they&rsquo;ll actually get from a plan for the cost. Is it a 5-Star plan? Is the&nbsp;<a href="/7-strategies-to-help-health-plans-deliver-great-member-service-even-when-staffing-cant-match-demand-2/">member service&nbsp;</a>excellent? The answers to these questions are going to be just as crucial to payers in the coming year.</p><p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) changed the formula for&nbsp;<a href="/cms-stars-update-changes-coming-in-measurement-year-2021/">Star Ratings for 2023</a>, doubling the impact of&nbsp;<a href="/focus-on-health-plan-member-experience-supports-star-ratings-increase-and-20m-in-additional-revenue/">CAHPS survey</a>&nbsp;results, patient experience, and complaints measures. These changes will give member experience four times the weight over previous years and will have the most impact on a plan&rsquo;s overall Star rating. CMS estimates a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/contract-year-2021-medicare-advantage-and-part-d-final-rule-cms-4190-f1-fact-sheet">$3.65 billion reduction</a>&nbsp;in reimbursement to payers in the next decade based on the revised formula &mdash; so consequences will abound for plans with lower Star ratings or those whose ratings drop thanks to the new methodology.</p><p>With member experience now mission-critical for payers, what can they do? We&rsquo;re sharing insights from Bo Young, Carenet Health&rsquo;s vice president of customer experience analytics: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about people first, then investing in the right technology and solutions.&rdquo;</p><p>Carenet&rsquo;s CX Analytics Group creates patient experience and service journey insights for clients through statistical sampling and calibrated human observations. By listening and reviewing a smart sample of member calls and text chats during a 30-day period, they&rsquo;re able to create data sets that can help payers invest in the right technology and implement process updates to improve net promoter scores and customer satisfaction scores, which can ultimately impact Star ratings.</p><p>You might ask, &ldquo;Can I really learn that much from 200 phone calls to improve CAHPS results?&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s walk through why human observation is a key tool for making improvements to earn the coveted&nbsp;<a href="/5-difference-makers-when-you-hire-a-healthcare-exclusive-bpo/">5-Star rating</a>.</p><h4><strong>Knowing your service journey is crucial to understand the total member journey</strong></h4><p>A member journey begins when a healthcare consumer chooses a Medicare Advantage or Part D plan. But much like a good play or TV show, the service journey begins with an inciting incident. Whether it&rsquo;s tripping on a rug and breaking a wrist or getting a Type II diabetes diagnosis, there will be an event that causes a member to reach out and begin a service journey. You can&rsquo;t build out your customer journey or make adjustments until you take stock of what your members currently go through before, during, and after engaging with your service agents.</p><h4><strong>Aiming for a frictionless experience&mdash;instead of an effortless one&ndash;is the goal</strong></h4><p>Aiming for an effortless experience for members is a high ideal we all wish we could live up to. But it&rsquo;s likely more realistic (and achievable!) to aim for a frictionless experience. The CX Analytics Group measures points of effort and points of friction throughout the member service journey.</p><p>Think about it: Let&rsquo;s say your internet goes out. You do some troubleshooting. That&rsquo;s a workstream. You can&rsquo;t get it to work, so you call your service provider and talk to an agent. That&rsquo;s a workstream. The agent talks to another agent&mdash;that&rsquo;s a workstream. The agent inputs info into a database&mdash;that&rsquo;s a workstream. And then finally, a truck rolls up to your house&mdash;yep, another workstream. These workstreams don&rsquo;t talk to each other&mdash;and that&rsquo;s a problem.</p><p>Listening in to recorded&nbsp;<a href="/7-strategies-to-help-health-plans-deliver-great-member-service-even-when-staffing-cant-match-demand-2/">member service&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;allows you to understand what&rsquo;s going on with your service. You learn what incites members to call, and any troubleshooting or steps they take before calling. Are your service agents having to complete a myriad of copying and pasting tasks to get through a process, causing dead air during calls? And then, what happens for the members after the phone call ends? Was the issue truly resolved from their perspective?</p><p>There will always be effort in the journey&mdash;it&rsquo;s about making it as easy as it can possibly be.</p><h4><strong>&lsquo;First call resolution&rsquo; should be &lsquo;first contact resolution&rsquo;</strong></h4><p>Member experience should be about meeting members at their moment of need, at their channel of choice. But it&rsquo;s often difficult to know what channel of choice they need because members might not know themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Resolution for some companies may mean that a service agent did everything they were supposed to do and answered the question. But what about the member? There may be follow-up steps for the member to take to actually resolve the issue. There&rsquo;s no way for the service agent to know if they actually completed that task.&nbsp;</p><p>The calibrated listening by the CX Analytics Group is centered in the member&rsquo;s perspective. By fully understanding what members go through before, during and after a member service interaction, you can improve processes through automation, process flow improvements, training and coaching opportunities, and more.</p><p>When was the last time you thoroughly reviewed your member service journey? Before investing in band-aid solutions, we suggest understanding your service journey through human observations first. It might help you save money in the long run and get your health plan to 5 Stars.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the human,&rdquo; Young said. &ldquo;Everything we do is from the patient&rsquo;s perspective, from the member&rsquo;s perspective, from the provider&rsquo;s perspective. And that&rsquo;s what unique.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p><strong>ABOUT CARENET HEALTH</strong></p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to talk more about&nbsp;<a href="/a-turning-point-in-the-complex-intersection-of-consumer-needs-changing-care-access-and-advocacy/">advocacy and navigation programs</a>&nbsp;and how they can address network leakage and improve Star ratings,&nbsp;<a href="/contact/">contact us today</a>. We&rsquo;re happy to schedule a conversation and share our insights from working with more than 100 of the&nbsp;<a href="/who-we-serve/">nation&rsquo;s most consumer-centric health plans</a>.</p>

							<p>You may have seen the signs at restaurants and retail stores lately, <a href="https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/region-pinellas/campaign-encourages-customers-to-practice-patience-while-dining" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asking for patience</a> when it comes to service levels. But health plans can&rsquo;t simply hang a sign on a door and hope for the best. Members can&rsquo;t (and shouldn&rsquo;t) put medical needs on hold, and they&rsquo;re probably not interested in labor shortage woes when something as important as health is at stake. Meanwhile, <a href="/focus-on-health-plan-member-experience-supports-star-ratings-increase-and-20m-in-additional-revenue/">health plan member satisfaction</a> is more important than ever.</p><p>Pandemic or not, <a href="/future-proofing-health-plans-will-legacy-workforce-strategies-survive/">customer service staffing challenges</a> are not going away. There will always be organizational change, crises and turnover, and competition in recruiting&mdash;at the same time that&nbsp;<a href="https://healthpayerintelligence.com/news/commercial-plan-member-satisfaction-jumps-10-percentage-points" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumer expectations and needs</a> shift.</p><p>A recent Verint study found that nearly 90% of business leaders surveyed said managing the workforce to meet the growing volume of customer interactions is one of their top concerns. Other major concerns voiced were overcoming silos for a unified view of customer engagement, using customer feedback to improve the service experience and creating lasting relationships with customers.</p><p>The good news is there are actions health plans can take to help remove pressure from their teams while providing service that keeps members satisfied. And today&rsquo;s labor shortage might be just the impetus your plan needs to rethink <a href="/co-sourcing-strategy-meets-rising-service-demands-and-exceeds-member-satisfaction-trends/">how member support is delivered</a>.</p><p>Here are some ideas we gathered from our Carenet Health engagement experts, including VP of Client Success Stacie Stoner and Director of Solution Development Monica Zapata, to inspire your next steps.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> #1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lean on automation and self-service. </strong></p><p>This strategy is a go-to tactic for a reason&mdash;it works. You likely have several automated processes and opportunities for your members to self-serve already. Yet our clients often find there is a lack of member awareness of those opportunities. We recommend re-evaluating your self-service selections to better understand if they&rsquo;re easy to find or buried, intuitive or complicated to use.</p><p>It also never hurts to re-evaluate member service steps and the tools and platforms you use internally. How can you make those tools work harder? Are there still manual steps within new digital interfaces that could be automated? Are there new AI/machine learning capabilities available? Could new service workflows speed up process steps?</p><blockquote><p>Consider calling your account representatives assigned to each of the customer relationship management (CRM) and other engagement systems you use and push for their thoughts on workflow and services automation.</p></blockquote><p><strong><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> #2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reconsider channel use&mdash;and consumer choice.</strong></p><p>When resources are tight and service demand is high, taking a hard look at your channel use can be valuable. <a href="/raising-cahps-scores-when-budget-is-tight/">Lower-cost channels</a> may be good options for shifting some of your member service interactions and redirecting some types of incoming member support needs.</p><p>This could mean contracting with a technical writer or <a href="https://medium.com/@dominic_11011/what-is-a-ux-expert-review-3199aa11c796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UX expert</a> to boost your online member services&rsquo; FAQs and help content. It could mean using interactive voice response (IVR), email, portal communications or text/SMS messages to proactively guide members to that content.</p><p>It could also mean investing in, or amping up the use of, AI-powered chatbots or other types of <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/natural-language-processing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural language processing (NLP)</a> solutions, including <a href="https://www.ultimate.ai/blog/ultimate-knowledge/what-is-an-intelligent-virtual-assistant-iva" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intelligent virtual assistants</a>. AI tools are becoming more and more sophisticated and can be complementary to live chat and phone interactions.</p><blockquote><p>Consumers want channel choice. Provide as many pathways as possible in your IVR, so members have a say in how they engage. An option like virtual hold (callback initiation) allows callers to hold their place in queue without waiting on the line. Alternatives like this demonstrate that you value your members&rsquo; time.</p></blockquote><p><strong><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> #3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Optimize those 1:1, live phone interactions.</strong></p><p>Human-to-human member support by phone will always provide a level of personalization, compassion and service that&rsquo;s difficult to replicate. It&rsquo;s also still one of the fastest ways for members to get their questions answered and issues resolved. (It&rsquo;s more efficient in problem-solving than typing, according to several studies, including&nbsp; <a href="https://www.ratatype.com/learn/average-typing-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a>.)</p><p>The key is to make sure your plan is continually looking for ways to improve the efficiency of those phone interactions&mdash;preferably in near-real time. Providing easy-to-use personal dashboards for team members is important, as is driving consistency in the engagement process. We suggest investing in additional training and coaching early and often.</p><blockquote><p>Reserve your human resource capacity for those members who not only desire it but need it. For additional insights on engagement optimization, <a href="/infographic-a-look-at-innovation-through-optimization-in-action/">check out this infographic</a>.</p></blockquote><p><strong><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> #4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use your data</strong>.</p><p>The more your service teams know about the individuals they&rsquo;re speaking with, the faster and more effective they can be. This requires that teams have access to complete and up-to-date member data. Also during live interactions, use every opportunity to capture and update as much information as possible.</p><blockquote><p><a href="/healthcare-engagement-trend-siloed-efforts/">Remove the engagement silos</a> while solving for data integration, and you&rsquo;ll see operational optimization become a reality in a short period of time.</p></blockquote><p><strong><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> #5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliminate ambiguity for members.</strong></p><p>When resources are outnumbered by member needs, precision matters even more in terms of ensuring members know where to go for the quickest, best answers. Consider: Do most of your members know how to get the information they need on the first try? Do they know where to click and what number to call? Have you recently surveyed members to know how you score in this area?</p><p>Website and other communications tools often rely on members to understand industry and organization jargon, or to have time and patience for unclear navigation. If directions and information are vague, or difficult to find, your members will go to your overburdened live service teams every time. Tightening up the ambiguity can make a substantial difference.</p><blockquote><p>We suggest performing a comprehensive but speedy audit. The audit can provide a solid grasp of how you&rsquo;re communicating about service touchpoints. In a perfect world, a focus group of members will be used to collect findings, as well.</p></blockquote><p><strong><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> #6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leverage flexible external teams that adjust to volume as needed.</strong></p><p>If wholly outsourcing your member services&rsquo; operations on a permanent basis isn&rsquo;t an option, consider working with an external health plan engagement partner to step in when seasonal or other high-demand periods put extra stress on your resources. Your workforce management processes can likely predict volume and help you proactively prepare for changes in demand, rather than simply reacting to unexpected long response times that frustrate members.</p><blockquote><p>When co-sourcing, consider keeping low-volume, high-complexity demands with your internal teams. Look to external partners to help with high-volume, low-to-medium complexity member needs.</p></blockquote><p><strong><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> #7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t push your teams too far.</strong></p><p>Perhaps the most important tip we can provide as an engagement organization that relies on the excellence and passion of hard-working teams is to stay on top of service volumes and team bandwidths.</p><p>In other words, know what your teams can handle, and what they can&rsquo;t. Direct sufficient resources to attacking burnout before it affects team and organizational health. It&rsquo;s critical that you not wait too long before taking action to relieve unsustainable workloads.</p><p>Customer service, especially in the world of <a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">healthcare engagement</a>, takes a special skillset. It also requires confidence, mental clarity and purpose. As a health plan, your goal should be to do all you can to support the individuals who speak on your behalf to those you ultimately serve.</p><p><strong>How can we help?</strong></p><p>Carenet Health can provide a wide range of options to help your internal teams during times of high demand, from <a href="/co-sourcing-strategy-meets-rising-service-demands-and-exceeds-member-satisfaction-trends/">co-sourcing strategies</a> to <a href="/gap-closing-strategies-for-medicare-plans-todays-tips-from-the-field/">innovative channel approaches</a>.

							Unpredictable things can happen. Natural disasters, weather emergencies, and other unforeseen circumstances can close your health care facility with little warning. When events like these happen, real-time communication with your patients is important to maintain satisfaction and provide a positive patient experience. Sending patient broadcast text messages can be the easiest and quickest way to contact your patients with urgent notices.
<h5>Broadcast Text Messages Are Key to Contacting Patients During Emergency Closures</h5>
When an emergency closure happens, it can wreak havoc on your schedule and cause an influx of calls, confusion, and frustration. A patient text messaging &nbsp;solution allows you to communicate quickly and efficiently across a large group of patients when information needs to be shared en masse. Here are three important <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-message-broadcast">text message broadcast</a> communications with examples to guide and inform patients:

1
<span style="font-weight: 700!important; font-size: 1.2em!important; padding: 0 0 0 10px!important;">Communicating Closures</span>



2
<span style="font-weight: 700!important; font-size: 1.2em!important; padding: 0 0 0 10px!important;">Sending Contact Information</span>



3
<span style="font-weight: 700!important; font-size: 1.2em!important; padding: 0 0 0 10px!important;">Sharing Reopening Details</span>


<h5>Use Patient Text Messages to Communicate Closures</h5>
When a natural disaster or inclement weather strikes, it can be unsafe for both the patients and providers. The conditions can make it dangerous for patients to travel, and it can become difficult for the facility to provide services when there is a loss of power or water supply issues. The first step in changing patients&rsquo; schedules on a large scale is to communicate the change. This is easily accomplished by sending a <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-message-broadcast">broadcast patient text message</a> letting all patients know the provider&rsquo;s office or health care facility will be closed and all appointments will need to be rescheduled.

<h5>Send Important Contact Information to Patients</h5>
When providers cannot make it into the office, they need a way to let patients know how to contact them if they need something, such as a refilled prescription. One option is to have an after-hours nurse triage phone line that can be utilized during an unforeseen closure. When events like this happen, it&rsquo;s also important to remind patients to call 9-1-1 in case of an emergency&mdash;even during inclement weather. Whatever you plan, make sure patients know how to get in contact with you during the service outage.

<h5>Share Reopening Details with Patients</h5>
Eventually, your office will be ready to open and start accepting patients again. If you know the date ahead of time, communicating that to patients in advance can help fill your schedule more quickly. Rather than calling all patients whose appointments were missed, use a convenient <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-message-broadcast">message broadcast</a> text to notify patients and caregivers that your office has reopened. Even more, include a link for patients to easily reschedule their missed appointment.&nbsp; If your building suffered damage prompting arrival instructions to change, be sure to include these details in an appointment confirmation text.

<h5>Patient Text Messages Aren&rsquo;t Just For Emergencies</h5>
Patient text messages can be powerful in an emergency, but it&rsquo;s also a valuable solution for everyday notifications and alerts, <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/how-to-promote-flu-and-rsv-vaccination-clinics-to-your-patients-and-members/">such as flu and RSV vaccine availability</a>. Here are a few more ways to utilize a text message broadcast solution:

<ul>
 	<li>Provider delays or schedule changes</li>
 	<li>Construction and entrance changes</li>
 	<li>Road closures</li>
 	<li>Location and building changes</li>
 	<li>Flu shot and other vaccine availability</li>
 	<li>New provider available at your facility</li>
 	<li>New office hours or contact information</li>
</ul>

Natural disasters and unforeseen emergencies are bound to happen in the future; however, your health system can be better prepared by having a <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-message-broadcast"> patient text message solution</a> that allows you to send broadcast communications at a moment&rsquo;s notice.

							<p>From closing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chartis.com/insights/bridging-gap-between-healthcare-organizations-and-public-health-entities-improve-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health equity gaps</a> to optimizing CMS Star ratings and keeping pace with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/1242490/Clinician-of-the-future-report-online.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital health technologies</a>, healthcare organizations have plenty of big picture topics that need their attention and focus.</p><p>Yet health plans and providers have to deliver top-quality customer service, too. For all the promises of technology, healthcare remains highly personal, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/trust-in-health-care-system.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trust</a>&nbsp;&ndash; or lack thereof &ndash; can make or break a relationship.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a tricky balancing act for any healthcare leader: Providing trusted, high-quality services and support without spreading resources too thinly across different platforms.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s where healthcare business process outsourcing (BPO) can really pay off. By outsourcing&nbsp;<a href="/how-are-healthcare-call-centers-different-than-traditional-call-centers/">healthcare call center</a>&nbsp;needs to a BPO focused on the healthcare industry, health plans and providers can save time and money, while providing patients and members the top-tier health-specific services they want and need.</p><p>Do your members need help navigating open enrollment? Are patients asking questions about their medication refills? A healthcare-focused BPO can answer questions like these with empathy and expertise.</p><p>Increasingly, plans and providers are turning to&nbsp;<a href="/outsource-vs-insource-a-3-point-checklist-for-healthcare-engagement/">healthcare engagement outsourcing</a>. The international healthcare BPO industry is&nbsp;<a href="https://healthcareweekly.com/healthcare-bpo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">projected to grow to almost $500 billion by 2026</a>.</p><p>Here are some of the key advantages you&rsquo;ll gain from choosing a healthcare BPO:</p><p><b>1) Healthcare BPOs provide deep subject matter expertise</b></p><p>The U.S. healthcare ecosystem is complex and subject to change. So are its workforce challenges as healthcare workers need to maintain specialized, up-to-date knowledge. Similarly, healthcare BPO workers know the latest industry rules and regulations, and they have the communication skills to match their technical chops</p><p>Unlike generalist BPOs that manage multiple industries,&nbsp;<a href="/beyond_a_healthcare_call_center/">healthcare call center</a>&nbsp;workers understand government regulations, licensing requirements and service-level mandates. They know about compliance programs, and have the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC) and National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) accreditations in place to ensure high-quality operations.</p><p>Larger BPOs that cover more than one industry can&rsquo;t match the specialized knowledge base of a healthcare BPO and won&rsquo;t be focused on evolving industry needs.</p><p><b>2) Healthcare-focused BPOs save you time</b></p><p>Working with multiple vendors for overlapping services just isn&rsquo;t efficient. Yet many major health plans still outsource about 25% of their customer touchpoints, typically with 6-7 different suppliers. Many want to consolidate services to reduce costs and platform conflict, while still communicating with members quickly and effectively.</p><p>A healthcare BPO can provide a one-stop solution that consolidates all your healthcare call center needs in one place.</p><p>Your teams won&rsquo;t need to learn about multiple systems&rsquo; workflows, and your IT department won&rsquo;t struggle with integrating and maintaining multiple vendors&rsquo; software.&nbsp;<a href="/defining-health-plan-member-engagement-what-does-it-really-mean/">Member engagement</a>&nbsp;will strengthen as consumers experience more meaningful interactions with your healthcare call center, deepening trust.</p><p>Startups in emerging markets like fitness technology that are considering whether to&nbsp;<a href="/customer-support-center-build-or-buy-series-the-question-of-training/">build or buy</a>&nbsp;a customer service solution can feel confident that a healthcare BPO will align with their specific needs as they scale.</p><p>Whether your organization is established or emerging, healthcare customer support outsourcing can free up your time to focus on growing your offerings and optimizing the quality of care.</p><p><b>3) Outsourcing saves money</b></p><p>All organizations want to save money. The bottom line matters in economic times, whether flush or lean. Employers know this, and also know that employees have evolving healthcare needs. As a result,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/employers-look-to-expand-health-benefits-while-managing-medical-costs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">employers want to expand health services while also managing healthcare costs</a>.</p><p>Healthcare organizations themselves are no different. Many major health plans have large in-house call centers that require time and resources to maintain. Healthcare customer service outsourcing may be a way for your organization to continue to offer best-in-class operations and support, while benefiting from cost savings, too.</p><p>Choosing a healthcare customer service outsourcing provider to manage multiple aspects of your business can also boost customer familiarity, satisfaction and loyalty.</p><p><b>4) Customer service expectations are rising, too</b></p><p>Consumer expectations are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/debgordon/2021/12/02/is-the-era-of-healthcare-consumerism-finally-here-new-survey-says-yes/?sh=18c145f73840" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soaring</a>&nbsp;and many consumer health behavior&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/health-industries/library/hri-insight-consumer-health-behavior-and-covid-19-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changes during the pandemic</a>&nbsp;are here to stay. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/new-research-reveals-global-consumer-trends-for-healthcare-life-sciences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent study</a>, 83% of consumers said their experience with an organization is as important as the product&mdash;but 47% said healthcare organizations care more about their own needs than those of their patients.</p><p>Investing in healthcare customer support outsourcing with a health-focused BPO is one way to close this gap. When patients and members feel they&rsquo;ve been treated personally while also getting the answers they need, loyalty can grow.</p><p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://freshdesk.com/help-desk-software/healthcare-customer-service-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patient-centric approach</a>&nbsp;is one way to provide great customer service in healthcare. With a healthcare BPO, you&rsquo;ll gain the advantage of deep industry knowledge, delivered by customer support teams that understand the importance of empathy and kind gestures during everyday&nbsp; interactions.</p><p><b>5) Digital transformation is here &ndash; yet customers still need a human touch</b></p><p>The pandemic also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-new-digital-edge-rethinking-strategy-for-the-postpandemic-era" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quickened adoption of new digital tools and technologies</a>. From telemedicine to AI chatbots to online mental health services,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/digital/10-ways-digital-could-transform-healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital tools are transforming healthcare</a>.</p><p>But&nbsp;<a href="/even-in-a-digital-world-human-to-human-phone-engagement-remains-critical-in-healthcare/">human-to-human telephone interactions</a>&nbsp;remain crucial in healthcare customer service.</p><p>Despite the allure of AI solutions, communication skills are particularly valuable in the field of healthcare, which is one of the most personal of all industries. Additionally, healthcare impacts nearly every consumer at different points of life.</p><p>And some customers prefer to engage with a human being, not an algorithm.</p><p>Healthcare BPOs like Carenet Health understand&nbsp;these unique pain points and can be trusted partners for health plans and providers.</p><p>By working with a healthcare-focused BPO, you won&rsquo;t be just a random division of a generalist BPO. This can help you free up organizational time to focus on improving health outcomes with confidence, knowing that your customers have a knowledgeable, kind source of support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>ABOUT CARENET HEALTH- Carenet Health is the nation&rsquo;s premier healthcare clinical and consumer engagement partner&mdash;providing 24/7 telehealth, engagement, clinical support and advocacy solutions on behalf of 250+ health plans, providers, health systems and Fortune 500 companies.

							<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/debgordon/2021/12/02/is-the-era-of-healthcare-consumerism-finally-here-new-survey-says-yes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumerism in every area, and healthcare is no exception.</a> Savvy health plan members have become more aware of their choices. Whether it&rsquo;s a telehealth versus in-office visit, at-home lab work or making an appointment by text, they want seamless, satisfying experiences around the clock.</p><p>Not only are members behaving in new ways, but health plan leaders are as well. They are beginning to see their market in the same customer-centric, retail-oriented way that banking, telecommunications and retailers see theirs:&nbsp;<em>a place where customer care along every point of the consumer experience matters</em>. By re-envisioning this experience, the health plan industry can see increased cost savings, efficiencies and outcomes.</p><p><strong>A Connected Journey</strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s think of the healthcare consumer experience as a journey of connections. Those connections are a series of &ldquo;touchpoint&rdquo; interactions between payers and members all along the customer life cycle.</p><p>As you can see&nbsp;<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Infinity_Slides90-Read-Only.jpg"><strong>HERE</strong></a>, touchpoints are actually interconnected parts of a whole&nbsp;<strong><em>Connected Consumer Journey</em></strong>. When expertly handled, they become seamless &ndash; and that significantly influences the customer&rsquo;s experience and perception of the health plan.</p><p><strong>Removing Barriers</strong></p><p>Traditionally, healthcare organizations have siloed their touchpoints, outsourcing as much as 30% to multiple suppliers. This approach doesn&rsquo;t work anymore; it is expensive, difficult to manage and creates barriers to seamless care. More healthcare organizations are responding by seeking consolidation strategies that reduce internal costs, internal infrastructure IT costs, and vendor management challenges.</p><p>The siloed approach no longer serves the needs of modern health plan members, either. Members should not have to spend 30 minutes on the phone and endure multiple departmental transfers just to get a question answered. Barriers create dissatisfied customers. According to research on consumer experiences from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/healthcare/commercial-member-health-plan-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J.D. Power</a>, insurers rank as the lowest of all industries in customer engagement. In fact, of the 35,000 members surveyed,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/health-plans-have-consumer-engagement-problem-jd-powers-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 64%</a>&nbsp;said they did not feel that health plans acted in their best interest. Only one-quarter of members viewed their health plan as a trusted partner in their health and wellness.</p><p>At Carenet Health, we believe the answer to these challenges is simple &ndash; consider the&nbsp;<strong><em>Connected Consumer Journey</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;wholistically</strong>, rather than its pieces. As the single-solution partner of choice, Carenet is able to seamlessly help organizations embrace the whole consumer experience by bringing together data,&nbsp;<a href="/about/technology/">technology</a>, talented&nbsp;<a href="/careers/">team members</a>&nbsp;and unique&nbsp;<a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">engagement models</a>&nbsp;for each touchpoint. And because of our clinical capital and deep consumer engagement expertise, we can manage both clinical and non-clinical touchpoints with equal ability&mdash;something most outsourcing partners cannot offer.</p><p><strong>Wholistic Partnering</strong></p><p>What might a wholistic response look like? Consider member Rosie Smith, who recently enrolled with a new health plan. During the plan&rsquo;s onboarding phase, Rosie received a welcome call from a highly trained Carenet customer service advocate. During the call, the advocate helped Rosie print a member identification card and find an in-network physician close to home. &nbsp;The advocate also made sure Rosie knew how to access her plan&rsquo;s 24-7 virtual care clinic. That information proved invaluable when Rosie tripped on her stairs over the long holiday weekend and her injured ankle quickly started to swell. Rosie wondered whether she should go to the emergency room, but then remembered her plan&rsquo;s virtual care team. After a virtual care visit, it was determined that Rosie had several abrasions and a bad sprain but could safely self-treat at home.</p><p>In our scenario, Rosie had a seamless and efficient member experience. One care advocate was able to help her with several tasks, and she was able to receive prompt care from her plan&rsquo;s virtual care resource. Rosie felt supported by her health plan and enrolled again at the end of her plan year. The health plan benefited by retaining a satisfied, loyal customer while avoiding a costly emergency department visit.</p><p>With our reputation for award-winning service, these are the kinds of experiences Carenet Health provides for our clients. As the nation&rsquo;s leading provider in healthcare-only resources, we are uniquely positioned to partner with health plans to support their&nbsp;<strong><em>Connected Consumer Journey</em></strong>. These connections have the power to improve care, outcomes, costs &mdash; and lives.</p><p>Is your organization ready to embrace a customer-centric, wholistic plan? If you are ready for a partner that can seamlessly assist you at every touchpoint while maximizing revenues, increasing efficiencies and helping your members make better healthcare decisions, contact Carenet today.&nbsp;<a href="/contact/">Find us online</a>, email us at marketing@carenethealthcare.com, or call 800.809.7000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additional Resources</p><p>Want to learn more?

							<p>In today&rsquo;s digital health world, health plan members, providers and payers all deserve seamless communication via the <a href="/how-to-close-more-care-gaps-with-a-multichannel-outreach-strategy/">channel</a> of their choice. Carenet Health&rsquo;s digital platform was created to remove obstacles for all stakeholders around access to care and coordination. Using one-of-a-kind communications and appointment scheduling technology plus a comprehensive network of providers, the digital platform opens the lines of communication with a special emphasis on the patient-provider relationship. Carenet&rsquo;s platform was developed as a way to enhance our healthcare engagement solutions&mdash;giving healthcare consumers personalized, tech-enabled care access in a way that&rsquo;s as easy as hailing an Uber. To help health plans and providers better understand what our digital platform offers, we put together this brief FAQ.</p><p><strong>What is the digital platform?</strong> It is a platform that helps health plans connect their members with providers. Health plans can use Carenet&rsquo;s platform to make appointments, request records, and make other requests from health providers in the United States and Puerto Rico. Its network of over 5.6 million providers includes physicians, dentists, mental and behavioral health providers, optometrists, nurses, home health aides, labs, pharmacies and more.</p><p><strong>Why do I need the Carenet digital platform?</strong> Carenet&rsquo;s platform helps health plans provide better care coordination for their members. Health plans can make requests from providers at any time. Because the platform is open access, those who use the platform&mdash;patients, providers, or payers&mdash;don&rsquo;t need login credentials or special connections. Easy access ensures continuity of care as well as equitable access to care. When you need a patient or a provider to take action, you need Carenet Health.</p><p><strong>Who can use the Carenet digital platform?</strong> Anyone can use the platform to make a request, but our solutions are designed for health plans, providers and ancillary service entities to use for communicating with patients and their healthcare providers. They can then <a href="/this-changes-everything-for-closing-gaps-in-care-expanded-solution-with-trailblazing-technology/">close care and risk assessment gaps</a> while improving the relationship between patients, providers and payers. Here are some other reasons payer organizations in particular use Carenet&rsquo;s platform:</p><ul><li>They need a cost-effective way to engage with members about care at scale</li><li>They want automated ways to ensure that members follow care plans</li><li>They need a way to get information from providers (such as chart pulls, claims information, medical history, network contracts) that do not require a fax or a phone call</li><li>They want to reduce operational costs; contacting thousands of members or providers by phone gets expensive</li><li>They want to improve member satisfaction with digital tools</li><li>They want to reduce outreach abrasion, communication attempts and plan member engagement fatigue</li><li>They want to meet the demands of healthcare consumerism</li></ul><p><strong>What can you do on the Carenet digital platform?</strong> The Carenet platform&nbsp;facilitates messages between providers and patients, inspiring them to take action. Here are a few ways our clients use the platform right now, but the options are limitless:</p><ul><li>Close HEDIS&reg;-related care gaps</li><li>Schedule appointments</li><li>Request physician order approvals</li><li>Facilitate prescriptions</li><li>Request medical records</li><li>Any other scheduling-related task</li></ul><p><strong>How does the Carenet technology work?</strong> The Carenet digital platform&nbsp;uses advanced and patented communications technology. Under the hood, you&rsquo;ll find the following:</p><ul><li>Automation and artificial intelligence</li><li>Asynchronous appointment setting for patients and providers</li><li>SMS/text, email, fax, portal, live outreach and interactive voice response (IVR) communication options</li><li>Personalized, proven messaging based on healthcare consumer behavioral science</li></ul><p><strong>Is Carenet&rsquo;s digital platform hard to implement for providers and health plans?</strong> The Carenet platform requires no integration, passwords, logins or sign-up. Anyone can access the system with the tap of a button on a computer or smartphone. If a healthcare organization chooses, they can opt to further implement with their internal systems.</p><p><strong>Does the Carenet platform offer telemedicine?</strong> The Carenet platform does offer a 24/7, on-demand telemedicine network when a patient would like to take that option&mdash;especially helpful when a provider hasn&rsquo;t yet responded to order requests for prescriptions or lab tests.</p><p><strong>Who is in the network of providers in the Carenet platform?</strong> The Carenet network includes 5.6 million-plus providers from across the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including all primary care physicians and specialists. Other network members include:</p><ul><li>Major U.S. pharmacies</li><li>S. mobile phlebotomy providers</li><li>All major U.S. diagnostic laboratories and high-complexity labs</li></ul><p>The network is a non-registered, open-access network&mdash;no provider of care or services signs up for it or pays to be included. The Carenet digital platform also includes highly skilled <a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">engagement</a> and logistics teams who support the work of the platform.</p><p><strong>How do I find out more about using the Carenet&rsquo;s digital platform?</strong> Call our team at 800.809.7000 or <a href="/contact/">send us a note</a>. We&rsquo;ll help you get started down a modern path to easier care access.</p>

							<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services" rel="noopener">medical call centers</a> do more than serve as an after-hours call center or overflow service for busy providers and office staff. The best <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services" rel="noopener">healthcare call centers</a> have both non-clinical and clinical agents who can answer patient questions quickly and easily, schedule appointments, make referrals, and communicate with patients in their preferred language.</p><p>However, few healthcare organizations pursue the full range of <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services" rel="noopener">medical call center services</a>, failing to capture their highest value and elevate the personalized, human touch that can make for an excellent patient experience. Here are five lesser-known <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services" rel="noopener">medical call center services</a> and best practices that you can leverage to improve <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/patient-engagement-solution" rel="noopener">patient engagement</a> and grow revenue.</p><h2 class="blog-subhead">1. PCP Recapture</h2><p>Every day, patients visit your urgent care centers and emergency departments. One in four indicate that they don&rsquo;t have a primary care physician (PCP ). Yet, few health systems reach out to patients to make a PCP referral in a timely manner.</p><p>Even more, according to a report from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) projects that the <a href="https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/us-physician-shortage-growing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States will face a shortage of between 54,100 and 139,000 physicians by 2033.</a> With physicians retiring early or changing practices, patients are often unsure where to turn. Connecting patients with a PCP encourages healthy behaviors, improves patient satisfaction, and increases retention and utilization of health system resources.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p><a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services" rel="noopener">BEST PRACTICE: Use a medical call center to follow up within a week (or less). Place an outbound call within 24 to 72 hours of a patient&rsquo;s visit to make a physician referral or to schedule an appointment.</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="blog-subhead">2. Answer Patient Questions via an Open Enrollment Hotline</h2><p>Partner with large employers in your area to help answer their employees&rsquo; questions, find physicians to meet their needs, schedule screenings, and deepen relationships during their annual benefits enrollment. Employers will appreciate the support, and employees will appreciate the individualized attention.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p><a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services" rel="noopener">BEST PRACTICE: Offer a live, 24/7, multilingual hotline where well-qualified, caring agents can answer questions and provide a personalized experience.</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="blog-subhead">3. Answer Patient Questions following an Online Health Risk Assessment</h2><p>Patient self-service and seeking answers online have become commonplace in the healthcare industry. But when patients take your online tests, quizzes, or health risk assessments to see if they&rsquo;re at risk for stroke, diabetes, or other conditions, what happens next? Some patients are hesitant to reach out, and your treatment teams rarely have extra time to follow up since they prioritize in-person care.</p><p><a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services" rel="noopener">Healthcare call centers</a> have specialized clinical teams or agents who are nurses that are qualified to call patients, ask and answer questions, and recommend next steps. Use a <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services" rel="noopener">medical call center</a> to conduct outbound campaigns to thank patients for their time and make sure they get to the right provider. Some patients may simply need a referral to a health coach, while others may be at higher risk or have more acute needs that require a more immediate response.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p><a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-intelligent-scheduling-solution" rel="noopener">BEST PRACTICE: Risk-stratify patients and prioritize outreach accordingly.</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="blog-subhead">4. Patient Portal and Telehealth Assistance</h2><p>Patient usage and familiarity with your health system&rsquo;s portal has always been important, but this past year, its significance skyrocketed. Patient portals are the gateway to scheduling, billing, test results, and telehealth services. Some systems now require patients to be portal users to take advantage of hybrid care. And if your organization introduces a new EHR, expect call volume to increase as offices are often flooded with calls when changing portals.</p><p>Health systems want patients to work through their patient portal but don&rsquo;t always have sufficient support or resources to answer questions and troubleshoot issues. It&rsquo;s like offering a software service without a customer service team. As you increase your emphasis on your patient portal, you must also increase your support. Offer a <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-medical-call-center-services" rel="noopener">multilingual hotline</a> to walk patients through portal set-up, help them navigate through the system, and demonstrate its value as a patient communication tool.</p><p>For one of our clients in 2020, our medical call center services team supported over 130,000 callers, which consisted of both patients and employees. 14% of the callers needed assistance with registration/activation of their portal, 22% of callers were experiencing login issues, and 13% were locked out of their portal accounts. Even more, 16% of these calls were for patients preparing for telehealth visits. For <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/covid-19-main-telehealth">telehealth calls,</a> our agents helped callers load the appropriate app onto their phones and walked them through the app process&mdash;ultimately preparing them for a successful virtual visit.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p><a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-intelligent-scheduling-solution" rel="noopener">BEST PRACTICE: Follow up calls with an informational email and &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; video link for future reference.</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="blog-subhead">5. Medical Call Centers can Support Health &amp; Wellness Campaigns</h2><p>When healthcare facilities closed and elective procedures were suspended last year, many patients canceled preventative appointments like mammograms, heart screenings, and more. It&rsquo;s time to reach out to your patients, express concern about their health, and remind them that your physicians and hospitals are back in service. Even more, you can share healthcare campaign information, sign patients up for classes or screenings, and promote additional services that help improve patients&rsquo; overall health and well-being.</p><p>Use a series of texts, emails, <em>and</em> phone calls to make sure patients know that you offer both telehealth and in-person appointments for services they may have missed. <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-intelligent-scheduling-solution" rel="noopener">Medical call centers</a> can help schedule patients either right into the EHR or by working directly with your office staff. Clients who have conducted outbound scheduling campaigns see as high as a 20% conversion rate of patients called to appointments booked.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p>BEST PRACTICE: Have an outbound call strategy, not just direct mail or ads, that targets at-risk patients and those who delayed preventative care appointments because of COVID-19.</p></blockquote><h2 class="blog-subhead">Medical Call Centers Provide Broad Patient Support</h2><p>Outsourcing one or more of these services to your <a href="https://engage.carenethealthcare.com/carenet-intelligent-scheduling-solution" rel="noopener">medical call center</a> can improve patient satisfaction and patient engagement while simultaneously helping to increase patient access and revenue.

							<p>For most people, omnichannel experiences are the norm&mdash;they expect to interact with brands on their website, on mobile apps, through SMS/text, AI chatbots, phone calls with customer service, and more. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/redefine-the-omnichannel-approach-focus-on-what-truly-matters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to McKinsey and Company</a>, more than half of consumers engage with three to five channels during each journey they take toward making a purchase or solving a request.</p><p>So why should it be any different in healthcare?</p><p>While voice-to-voice, live and personal communication is still critical to motivating and persuading members, taking a multichannel approach to boost HEDIS engagement is fundamental. It also shows that you&rsquo;re putting members&rsquo; needs first&mdash;and letting them choose how they want to engage with you.</p><p><strong>Why a multichannel HEDIS engagement strategy is more effective</strong></p><p>One of the most common outreach tools in health plans <a href="/support-for-your-hedis-and-star-ratings-improvement-efforts/">HEDIS engagement toolkit</a> is the phone call. While it&rsquo;s true that when it comes to Medicare members, the phone call is still a go-to strategy, it&rsquo;s also true that getting a member to answer your phone call is another matter.</p><p>Despite sophisticated data appends, advanced CRM technology and predictive dialing strategies that can increase contact success by a substantial amount, it is simply harder these days to get people to pick up a phone. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/10/30/the-challenges-of-contact-tracing-as-u-s-battles-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Pew Research</a>, 8 in 10 Americans no longer answer the phone when an unknown number calls.</p><p>This is why a <a href="/a-better-engagement-approach-can-close-hedis-gaps/">multichannel HEDIS engagement strategy</a> is essential and more effective. By combining interactive voice response (IVR) or SMS/text messaging before attempting phone calls, you can &ldquo;warm up&rdquo; or prime a member to interact. You&rsquo;ve established familiarity so that by the time you do call the member, you&rsquo;re not only no longer an &ldquo;unknown number,&rdquo; but the member is anticipating the call.</p><p><strong>Priming members for engagement through text</strong></p><p>Text is a powerful communication tool&mdash;and shouldn&rsquo;t be overlooked as a strategy on how to <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CarenetHealth_HEDIS_Star_Offerings.pdf">close more gaps in care</a>. Whether you&rsquo;re trying to schedule preventive care, follow up on <a href="/hedis-engagement-root-causes-of-appointment-refusals-and-how-to-change-a-no-to-a-yes/">missed appointments</a> or schedule annual wellness appointments, text can significantly boost patient engagement.</p><p>Not only do <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">97% of Americans</a> now own a cellphone of some kind, but text is also their preferred communication channel. According to recent research, <a href="https://www.podium.com/guides/2022-local-business-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">67%</a> of consumers believe being able to text with a business would increase convenience. Additionally, texts have a 98% open rate, with 95% of texts opened within three minutes. On an engagement scale of one to ten&mdash;that&rsquo;s a ten.</p><p><a href="/contact/">Carenet Health</a> data shows similar engagement levels when conducting HEDIS outreach. Our data shows a 70% member activation rate when calls are paired with text-based engagement solutions.</p><p><strong>Putting a multichannel HEDIS engagement strategy into action</strong></p><p>While text, phone and IVR may be the most obvious communication channels, the list of digital channels keeps growing. As a result, members are looking for multichannel options so they can choose the channel that meets their needs at the moment.</p><p>The Carenet Health&rsquo;s digital&nbsp;platform offers a number of digital communication capabilities and asynchronous scheduling opportunities to help boost HEDIS outreach and close care gaps.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the platform is unique in that it drives both member and provider action and ensures continuity of care by leveraging:</p><ul><li>Automation and artificial intelligence</li><li>Asynchronous appointment setting plus direct bookings</li><li>SMS/text, email, live outreach and IVR</li><li>Personalized, proven messaging</li></ul><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a way to increase your HEDIS engagement scores, we can help. <a href="/contact/">Contact us</a> to start a conversation, or for more best practices on increasing HEDIS engagement, download our <a href="/hedis-best-practice-guide/">Health Plan HEDIS Best Practices Guide</a>.</p>

							<p>Closing <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/SpecialNeedsPlans/SNP-HEDIS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HEDIS&reg;-related</a> care gaps for large numbers of health plan members and patients has long been a challenge for payers and other organizations concerned about value-based care and related quality and cost measures. Outreach has been expensive and cumbersome, and achieving strong return on investment hasn&rsquo;t been easy.</p><p><strong>Why is it so hard to close gaps in care?</strong></p><p>The reasons for the challenges are many, but they start with a healthcare delivery system that&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2019-12-11/survey-finds-fragmented-us-health-care-impedes-coordination-among-providers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fragmented</a>, confusing and anything but convenient. Healthcare consumers are often frustrated and simply don&rsquo;t take action on necessary care prevention and treatment adherence. Even when a patient or member is motivated and engaged, there are multiple friction points along the way to an appointment completion; crossing the finish line is often difficult. (And that&rsquo;s not even considering the coding issues that can be a problem between providers and payers, which can impact whether a gap has really been closed.)</p><p><strong>Innovation and optimization in HEDIS engagement</strong></p><p>At Carenet Health, we&rsquo;ve been leading successful <a href="/hedis-best-practice-guide/">HEDIS engagement efforts</a> for our clients for years. But we also know that <a href="/infographic-a-look-at-innovation-through-optimization-in-action/">optimization and innovation</a> are everything. We are always looking for ways to seamlessly reach more members and more providers, schedule more appointments faster and with less work on everyone&rsquo;s part, and deliver it all at an affordable cost for <a href="/who-we-serve/">our clients</a>.</p><p><strong>Now, with our digital platform, Carenet is able to offer an even more comprehensive and higher-performing HEDIS engagement solution.</strong></p><p>The enhanced solution includes technology-driven, bi-directional communication and access to care&mdash;and engages BOTH members and providers digitally first, before any 1:1 live phone outreach is attempted.</p><p><strong>Highlights of the expanded solution for closing gaps in care</strong></p><p>At a big-picture level, the new Carenet Health solution delivers more effective and efficient gap closures and appointment-setting on a large scale via:</p><ul><li>Patented, no-integration-needed technology that requires no login or credentials for anyone to use</li><li>Access to the industry&rsquo;s largest database of providers (Carenet&rsquo;s proprietary network includes all PCPs in the U.S. and Puerto Rico and much more)</li><li>A focus on the power of the patient-doctor relationship</li><li>Automated yet personalized messaging</li><li>Asynchronous communications and actions</li><li>Simplified member decision-making</li></ul><p>Clients can expect that use of Carenet&rsquo;s digital platform&nbsp;alone can increase gap-closure conversion rates by a minimum of 20%-30% over other methods of outreach. After a certain number of days (determined by the client), the client can choose to add live phone outreach by Carenet&rsquo;s <a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">highly skilled healthcare engagement teams</a> to reach out to both members and providers not activated through the digital platform. This can improve yield by another 20% to 30%.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18759 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Vector-Smart-Object-1024x614.png" alt="" width="800" height="480"></p><p><strong>So much more than multichannel engagement</strong></p><p>This isn&rsquo;t just a typical digital channel solution, though. Let&rsquo;s break it all down a little more.</p><ul><li>First, we leverage the open-network digital platform to send large volumes of highly personalized messages with the touch of a button.</li><li>AI-driven, behavioral science-based messaging sends messages via consumers&rsquo; preferred channels&mdash;texts, emails, apps, interactive voice response.</li><li>Each message includes the name of the individual&rsquo;s primary care physician if available (or nearby, in-network options if not). Our communications offer patients the confidence of knowing these are physician-recommended actions they need to take.</li><li>Members choose from a set of appointment options on their own time; practices receive and confirm on their own time.</li><li>There are no friction points, no three-way calling needed, no engagement fatigue or member abrasion.</li><li>Practices also receive codes for easy EMR notes, care and billing with appointment requests.</li><li>Automated follow-ups are deployed to ensure appointments occurred.</li><li>Continuous outreach can be triggered by new data; no starts and stops of engagement campaigns.</li></ul><p>As a final step, we leverage our industry-renowned phone engagement teams to help those who haven&rsquo;t responded yet.</p><p><strong>Think of this enhanced solution as a bit like the restaurant world&rsquo;s OpenTable app, but for appointment scheduling.</strong></p><p>Now for a quick recap of the problem&mdash;and the solution.</p><p><img class="wp-image-18761 size-full aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/OM_Charts.png" alt="" width="1022" height="418"></p><p>If you&rsquo;re interested in learning more, <a href="/contact/">please reach out to us</a> as soon as possible, as demand is high. You can also <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/229523ef-1b2c-4b13-903e-d0bba188c3fd.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download this overview</a>.</p><pre><em>Note: HEDIS&reg; is a registered trademark of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA).</em></pre>

							<p>If your healthcare organization is working to improve the consumer experience, an outstanding <a href="/beyond_a_healthcare_call_center/">healthcare support center</a> should be a high priority. Yet there are issues complicating that effort, such as:</p><ul><li><a href="/future-proofing-health-plans-will-legacy-workforce-strategies-survive/">Hiring challenges</a> for frontline support and licensed healthcare staff</li><li>New consumer and end-user expectations</li><li>Evolving digital technologies that require investment</li><li>The heavy technology lift for remote, in-office and hybrid work</li><li>Information security requirements</li></ul><p>These factors are causing leaders to rethink whether they should build or restructure their own internal contact center or if they should work with a partner that can deliver a cost-effective support center.</p><p>This Build or Buy blog series aims to help you with the <a href="/outsource-vs-insource-a-3-point-checklist-for-healthcare-engagement/">insource vs. outsource decision</a>. In Part 1, we examined <a href="/build-or-buy-should-you-insource-your-healthcare-customer-support-center-or-select-a-partner/">Accreditations and Certifications</a>. Now, we take a look at training a high-quality customer support staff.</p><p><span style="color: #D31C5B; font-size: x-large;"><strong>Part 2: Training considerations</strong></span></p><p>In deciding whether to insource, outsource or co-source your healthcare consumer support, one thing to consider is that, if you were to partner with a healthcare customer service vendor, they would be responsible for designing, implementing, improving, refreshing and monitoring the effectiveness of staff training.</p><p>As you weigh your options, here are a few questions to think about:</p><ul><li>Does a high level of training matter to your organization for service and support team roles? Why or why not?</li><li>Is your training department ready to provide the level of education and support necessary now and in your organization&rsquo;s future to meet your goals?</li><li>How will the level of training that service representatives receive impact your organization&rsquo;s bottom line? Could it have a sizeable effect on satisfaction and revenue? (This is often a major concern for health plans and health systems, given the importance of CAHPS and CMS Stars programs.)</li><li>Do you have the resources, or could you increase your resources, to train a new team quickly based on market and organizational demands?</li><li>What would be the cost in time and money for your organization to train your support staff to the same high standards as those of an outside vendor who specializes in <a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">healthcare consumer engagement</a>?</li></ul><p>For further insight into how a high-quality healthcare support partner might handle training, let&rsquo;s review some highlights of how training works at Carenet Health.</p><p><strong>Specialized content and techniques </strong></p><p>At Carenet, our healthcare customer service team members receive specialized training that goes well beyond software use and call scripts. For example, we train our support staff in <a href="https://motivationalinterviewing.org/understanding-motivational-interviewing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motivational interviewing</a> and empathy. With these competencies, our engagement staff are better able to help patients identify and achieve health goals.</p><p>We also train our staff in cultural, health-condition and age sensitivities. For example, if teams will be engaging with members who may have experienced a mental health issue, we train them on how to sensitively and effectively assist these patients.</p>						
				
				
				
							<p>Did you know Carenet Health has highly customized training modules for each type of population our support specialists serve&mdash;including Medicare and Medicaid plan members?</p>						
				
				
				
							<p>Carenet continually refines its training content based on best practices and knowledge we collect from more than 70,000 patient and health plan member interactions every day &hellip; for our over <a href="/who-we-serve/">250 exclusively healthcare clients</a>.</p><p>We train healthcare specialists for both inbound and outbound customer service and support. Our team members not only learn how to effectively answer incoming calls and provide real-time assistance, but also how to execute outgoing communications relating to particular health initiatives or engagement campaigns.</p><p>Regardless of content, Carenet can extend flexibility in training within your system, a partner system or proprietary Carenet systems.</p>						
				
				
				
							<p>At Carenet Health, each new customer support team member receives, at minimum, training on:</p><ul><li>Program specifics + client organizational values and culture</li><li>Population and related sensitivities (age, culture, health literacy)</li><li><a href="/health-plan-member-satisfaction-are-you-just-an-information-provider-or-are-you-building-trust/">Empathy and how to convey it virtually and via multiple channels</a></li><li>Technical/technology platform skills</li><li><a href="/beyond-engagement-strategies-for-persuasion-and-influence/">Consumer influence strategies</a>, relationship-building and engagement/action triggers</li></ul>						
				
				
				
							<p>All of this content development doesn&rsquo;t happen in a vacuum. With a combined 50+ years of experience in global service and support, our training team have spent their careers refining the techniques and knowledge transfer models that work best.</p><p><strong>Advanced tools and systems</strong></p><p>Carenet Health&rsquo;s healthcare services center training is delivered in a sophisticated, flexible way that emphasizes job immersion and spaced repetition.</p><p>For example, our leading-edge training platform recreates the screen interfaces that team members will be using during on the job. As such, patient service reps get to practice in a &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; that delivers the same tools they&rsquo;ll be using once they&rsquo;re providing live assistance. Plus, our training involves simulations of calls and interactions in which our engagement specialists respond to defined scenarios and receive real-time, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artificial intelligence</a> (AI)-driven feedback. These practice calls are also recorded and shared with the individuals and their coaching staff, who then discuss opportunities for excellence.</p><p>Carenet&rsquo;s training includes a variety of formats. Some of the content is self-paced, while some is instructor-led. We also included gamified quizzes and have a state-of-the-art training studio for virtual learning (80% of our frontline staff work remotely). This approach to training is much more engaging and effective than simply having to passively absorb lectured materials or read training manuals.</p>						
				
				
				
							<p>Healthcare consumer experience teams at Carenet Health even have the opportunity to attend and watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TED Talk</a>-like videos as part of their training in customer service excellence.</p>						
				
				
				
							<p><strong>Continuous learning and optimization </strong></p><p>Customer support training should never be a once-and-done for new hires or even a periodic experience; it needs to be continuous for ongoing improvement. At Carenet, our training program includes rolling training opportunities and job aids that prompt teams on how to handle challenging tasks&mdash;to help refresh skills cyclically.</p><p>In addition, when process changes are needed, perhaps because of a change in a client&rsquo;s procedure or software tool, our training platform can walk service staff through the transitions with detailed and engaging training, all developed by our internal and highly skilled team.</p><p>Finally, a robust training program like the one at Carenet should always include formal processes for optimization. Leaders should continually ask: How can we make this training more effective, more efficient? How can our learners absorb more and perform better, and progress faster? The goal is higher performance in decreased learning time.</p>						
				
				
				
							<p>Recent optimizations in Carenet Health&rsquo;s healthcare customer service training programs have produced a 30% decrease in training time needed for engagement specialists, with no decrease in first 30-day work performance.</p>						
				
				
				
							<p><strong>Choosing the best path to a superior healthcare consumer experience</strong></p><p>All of the above-mentioned training development and technology costs money, of course. These are the kind of long-term business investments that a premier healthcare contact center would agree are important and necessary to support clients well. At Carenet, they are one of the prices we pay to produce the kind of <a href="/category/content-type/case-study/">results that help us stand out in the industry</a>.</p><p>Can you build this type of sophistication in your internal training capabilities? Absolutely. The tradeoff will be in costs, time and staffing resources.</p><p>You also may be wondering if all these training solutions and innovations really matter. Couldn&rsquo;t you instead simply aim for some basic standard of competency among your patient and health plan service teams and create a straightforward, conventional training program that achieves that? You could, of course, but there are risks.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve likely experienced patient service or health plan support agents as a healthcare consumer yourself. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve encountered an agent who couldn&rsquo;t answer your question or who didn&rsquo;t seem very empathetic to your concern. Or maybe they answered your question, but you felt rushed, or the representative lacked confidence in the information provided. Did that experience leave you wishing you had a different health insurance or provider?</p><p>When your healthcare support agents are effectively trained, they contribute to a <a href="/delivering-an-outstanding-healthcare-experience-and-solving-top-industry-challenges-start-with-integrated-engagement-strategy/">superior experience</a> with each touchpoint. And that superior consumer journey, can in turn, lead to <a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/cahps/quality-improvement/improvement-guide/2-why-improve/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved outcomes</a> and <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/tr/Documents/life-sciences-health-care/lchs-the-value-of-patient-experience.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved financial performance</a>.</p><p>&mdash;-</p><p><em>Be sure to check back for new articles in this series.

							<p>Gaps in care are an increasing problem for healthcare organizations. During the pandemic, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6936a4.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40% of U.S. adults</a> delayed or avoided medical care. At any given time, <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.1130" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four out of five Medicare patients</a> fail to get an annual wellness visit, and only <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.1248" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8% of adults</a> over 35 comply with recommended preventative health services.</p>
<p>For many health plan members and patients with chronic or other health issues, there are a number of obstacles to obtaining medical care. These barriers can range from a growing clinician shortage to a lack of reliable transportation to living far from care. These issues are often exacerbated for rural patients. (In fact, data shows that less than <a href="https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/rural-health-disparities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8% of all physicians and surgeons</a> choose to practice in rural settings.)</p>
<p>At the same time, there is an increasing prevalence of chronic disease and an expanding and aging population. Additionally, pandemic-related concerns have some patients hesitant to seek in-person care.</p>
<p>The confluence of all these trends has made closing care gaps more challenging than ever for health plans. Yet resolving lingering care gaps remains critical to your members&rsquo; and your organization&rsquo;s health.</p>
<p>The good news is that offering <a href="/whats-on-the-horizon-for-telehealth-four-trends-to-watch/">telehealth</a> and <a href="/how-to-address-the-deferred-care-crisis-in-home-care-for-starters/">at-home care</a> alternatives can be an effective strategy to improve your HEDIS&reg; engagement and get members the preventative care they need while <a href="/hedis-engagement-root-causes-of-appointment-refusals-and-how-to-change-a-no-to-a-yes/">circumventing many of the obstacles that may have been causing missed appointments</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Telehealth is now a tried, tested and adopted care solution, even for annual wellness visits</strong></p>
<p>The trend is clear: <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/telehealth-a-quarter-trillion-dollar-post-covid-19-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nearly half</a> of all healthcare consumers are using telehealth for some health need, according to McKinsey and Company.</p>
<p>By offering telehealth to members when scheduling HEDIS-related appointments, including annual wellness visits, you can overcome many of your members&rsquo; hesitations. For instance, if a member&rsquo;s main hesitation is that they don&rsquo;t think they have time for a medical appointment right now, you can counter with the convenience of telehealth. Some appointments can be as short as 15-30 minutes, and there&rsquo;s no additional travel time.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/pubs/telehealth.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Community Preventative Services Task Force</a>, telehealth can also be beneficial in increasing <a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">healthcare engagement</a> around treating and managing chronic disease risk factors in patients. In particular, telehealth can improve medication adherence, clinical outcomes (such as blood pressure control) and dietary outcomes (such as reducing sodium intake).</p>
<p><strong>At-home care alternatives can increase HEDIS engagement</strong></p>
<p>In a survey by <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/health-industries/library/hri-insight-consumer-health-behavior-and-covid-19-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PwC Health Research Institute</a>, three-quarters of consumers surveyed said they were willing to get in-home care for needs ranging from a well visit to chronic disease management. This is also good news for boosting your <a href="/support-for-your-hedis-and-star-ratings-improvement-efforts/">HEDIS engagement scores</a> and closing care gaps.</p>
<p>At-home care can cover chronic conditions, such as testing for diabetes and preventative screenings, such as colon cancer tests. Additionally, mobile phlebotomy networks and at-home MD organizations can offer care for everything from wellness exams to lab draws to post-recovery follow-ups.</p>
<p>At-home care also has the added potential to unlock &ldquo;higher-quality of care for consumers at a lower cost for health systems,&rdquo; according to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/how-care-at-home-ecosystems-can-reshape-the-way-health-systems-envision-patient-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinsey and Company</a>. By 2025, McKinsey predicts that an <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/from-facility-to-home-how-healthcare-could-shift-by-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated $265 billion worth of care services</a> (representing up to 25% of the total cost of care) for Medicare and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries could shift to at-home care.</p>
<p><strong>Using appointment scheduling technology to make closing care gaps easier</strong></p>
<p>When doing outreach to members to address HEDIS care gaps, having a simplified approach to connecting and coordinating care can make it much easier for both members and providers to schedule the appropriate care&mdash;whether that&rsquo;s at home or via telehealth.</p>
<p>The Carenet Health digital platform&rsquo;s turnkey solution can make facilitating telehealth and at-home care faster and easier, further enabling health plans and providers to close care gaps and increase HEDIS engagement scores.</p>

							<p>Healthcare organizations&mdash;payers, providers and anyone who serves today&rsquo;s healthcare consumers&mdash;are smartly beginning to focus more attention, time and resources on understanding and mapping the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7557979/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare consumer journey</a>. It&rsquo;s something other industries have been doing since the 1990s. Now,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20190304.69786/full/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare consumerism</a>&nbsp;is causing healthcare to dig into the health plan member and patient experience, as well.</p><p>Numerous steps and a wide range of emotional and physical touchpoints make up an end-to-end customer journey, and all of them can be critical to maximizing satisfaction, loyalty and even care outcomes and costs. Those steps and touchpoints are absolutely important for healthcare leaders to study.</p><p>But there is one in particular that we see consistently undervalued in healthcare organizations&rsquo; assessments&mdash;the&nbsp;<strong>Healthcare Service Journey</strong>.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s an example from the world of mobile devices to explain the difference:</p>						
				
				
				
							<p>The&nbsp;<em>consumer journey</em>&nbsp;with a smartphone began 10 years ago when the consumer researched their first mobile phone purchase. But the&nbsp;<em>service journey</em>&nbsp;began last night when the email on the customer&rsquo;s phone didn&rsquo;t sync.</p>						
				
				
				
							<p>Think of the Service Journey as a micro-journey imbedded within the overall consumer journey. Here&rsquo;s an example from the world of healthcare:</p>						
				
				
				
							<p>The&nbsp;<em>consumer journey</em>&nbsp;with a member&rsquo;s health plan began two years ago when they began their search for a Medicare Advantage plan. But their Healthcare Service Journey began this morning when they had a question about finding an in-network specialist.</p>

							<p><strong>The goal: Frictionless experiences</strong></p><p>Every organization that serves consumers wants to create an <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/effortless-experience-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effortless experience</a>. While that&rsquo;s a lofty goal, we encourage <a href="/who-we-serve/">our healthcare clients</a> to instead work to design a frictionless experience. To do that, health plans, health systems and healthcare service organizations need to break down their consumer journey into individual and distinct Healthcare Service Journeys. For each Healthcare Service Journey, you can then identify all points of effort and points of friction.</p><p><strong>For Healthcare Service Journeys, consider the past, present and future</strong></p><p>To understand the Healthcare Service Journey, we believe you should start with three key questions&mdash;which ultimately explore what happens in the <em>past</em>, in the <em>present</em> and in the <em>future</em>.</p><p>Those questions are:</p><ol><li>What did the patient or plan member do before they engaged with your support services? (regardless of channel&mdash;could be live/phone, text, email or portal touchpoint)</li><li>How successful was the engagement, from the consumer&rsquo;s perspective? (not the organization&rsquo;s)</li><li>What needed to be done at the end of the engagement to achieve true resolution, and who owns that next step?</li></ol><p><strong>Micro-journeys reveal what&rsquo;s going beyond individual healthcare customer service interactions, too</strong></p><p>Another important point to remember is that analyzing the complete Healthcare Service Journeys that your members and patients experience offers a strategic look into not only the actual <a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">engagement and support</a> opportunities you offer, but also how those opportunities are impacting your overall organization. For instance, you can learn:</p><ul><li>What caused the patient or health plan member to engage with you in the first place</li><li>What&rsquo;s working and not working when consumers try to self-service, and why</li><li>Substantial insights into how consumers feel overall about your care and services</li></ul><p><strong>Are you missing opportunities to impact your healthcare consumers&rsquo; lives?</strong></p><p>In summary, next time your organization is discussing and examining the customer journey, take a step back and ask: What Healthcare Service Journeys make up that larger experience and how can optimizing them change things <a href="/about/">for the better</a>? Are your Healthcare Service Journeys creating positive and lasting satisfaction and loyalty? If that answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; you could be missing opportunities to meet your plan members and patients at their moment of need, in their channel of choice. And that&rsquo;s a moment when you can genuinely affirm and reinforce the confidence, time and money they&rsquo;ve invested in partnering with you for their health and wellbeing.</p><p><strong>Focus on improving the Healthcare Service Journey, and improvement of the revenue-generating consumer journey will follow. </strong></p><p>&mdash;</p><p><a href="/">Carenet Health</a> has launched a new <a href="/carenet-health-launches-cx-analytics-capability-to-help-payers-and-providers-optimize-the-healthcare-service-journey/">CX Analytics Group</a> made up of an experienced team that has collectively completed hundreds of comprehensive service-journey related studies for a wide range of consumer-centric industries, including e-commerce and financial services.

							<p>The world of healthcare consumer engagement and experience&mdash;from health equity and virtual care needs to the most fundamental actions of customer service&mdash; is gaining ground and beginning to undergo <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="/2022-will-be-turning-point-for-healthcare-consumer-experience-according-to-forecast-from-carenet-health/">significant change</a>.</p><p>At <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carenet Health</a>, we believe the next several years will be transformational. Both payers and providers are thinking about how they can care for their members and patients in new and better-integrated ways.</p><p>Meanwhile, Carenet Health is putting additional building blocks in place to ensure we are in the best position to help our clients succeed in a new age of <a href="https://patientengagementhit.com/news/breaking-down-the-basics-of-healthcare-consumerism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare consumerism</a> and engagement. We sat down with Carenet CEO <a href="/about/meet-the-team/">John Erwin and Steve Harstad</a>, EVP of Strategic Accounts, to talk more about where the organization and the industry are headed.</p><p><strong>Let&rsquo;s start with what&rsquo;s been happening at Carenet&mdash;a lot of exciting additions and changes have been on the docket lately.</strong></p><p><span style="color: #d31c5b;">John:</span> We couldn&rsquo;t be more excited about the direction of the organization. Early this year we announced the launch of a <a href="/carenet-health-launches-cx-analytics-capability-to-help-payers-and-providers-optimize-the-healthcare-service-journey/">Carenet CX Analytics Group</a>. The group&rsquo;s first consulting and analytics offering will apply proven methodologies used in industries like e-commerce and financial services to the healthcare Service Journey for the first time.</p><p><span style="color: #e87722;">Steve:</span> We&rsquo;re definitely putting all of the pieces in place to grow the organization and ensure we&rsquo;re ready for our client&rsquo;s scalability needs and our continued expansion, as well. We&rsquo;re investing in meaningful partnerships, <a href="/carenet-health-adds-three-leaders-to-executive-team-in-anticipation-of-rapid-growth/">bringing on experienced leaders</a>, and adapting our client relationships for heightened alignment around improving the healthcare consumer experience.</p><p><span style="color: #d31c5b;">John:</span> Right. It&rsquo;s all about adding to our depth and breadth, finding more ways to add more value.</p><p><strong>Let&rsquo;s explore that further. What does that really mean in the day-to-day for clients who partner with us?</strong></p><p><span style="color: #d31c5b;">John:</span> I think our clients are concerned about flexibility. Costs. Revenue. And figuring out the way forward. They know the game is changing&mdash;consumers want 24/7 access, they want convenience, they want tech-enabled service, they want relationships with their health plan and providers. Working with us, we can talk about those things and help them meet those needs, whether they ultimately leverage our solutions or not. We want them to succeed and benefit from our collective learnings of working with 250-plus health plans, health systems and healthcare service companies.</p><p><span style="color: #e87722;">Steve:</span> There&rsquo;s benefit in helping our clients fail faster, too. Healthcare organizations&rsquo; structures aren&rsquo;t always set up with a culture of being able to try new things, fail, learn and move on with more insights. But ours is, and we can share what we discover.</p><p><strong>The clinical and customer service staffing challenges out there are probably on those clients&rsquo; minds, as well.</strong></p><p><span style="color: #e87722;">Steve:</span> Absolutely. The key will be combining things like AI, digital and automation with high-quality, smartly sourced teams. This is true for both nurse- or other clinician-led support and the customer service function, as well. We&rsquo;re in a unique position to help from a variety of angles.</p><p><span style="color: #d31c5b;">John:</span>&nbsp;And now we&rsquo;re able to analyze the holistic Service Journey, really evaluate the friction points. This will be huge for our clients to optimize costs and consumer touch-points. That&rsquo;s also going to be so important as healthcare organizations rethink the best ways to deploy resources and <a href="/future-proofing-health-plans-will-legacy-workforce-strategies-survive/">shift their service models</a>.</p><p><strong>Given all the change and challenges we&rsquo;ve discussed, what are some of the immediate impacts you see in terms of the healthcare consumer experience? </strong></p><p><span style="color: #e87722;">Steve:</span>&nbsp;The industry is more focused than ever on the healthcare consumer experience, and that trend will only mature. For payers and providers, and especially those operating under<a href="https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.18.0197" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> risk-based models</a>, that may mean innovative technologies. Almost certainly it will mean better use of data and analytics, and the redesign of not only services and benefits but also service interactions. So, we&rsquo;ll all need to be continually digging into the data and science of it.</p><p><span style="color: #d31c5b;">John:</span> It will also mean determining if the right infrastructure is in place to support the more demanding healthcare consumer of tomorrow.</p><p><span style="color: #e87722;">Steve:</span> Yes, let&rsquo;s put solutions in place that are not only tech-driven but also service-driven. Let&rsquo;s aim for personalization and convenience for patients and health plan members&mdash;like they are used to in other areas of their lives as consumers.</p><p><span style="color: #d31c5b;">John:</span> In healthcare, we all have to be more thoughtful about making the consumer&rsquo;s life easier and less costly.</p><p><span style="color: #e87722;">Steve:</span>&nbsp;When it&rsquo;s all said and done, healthcare is a consumer business. Patients and health plan members are customers. We shouldn&rsquo;t take that for granted. <a href="/delivering-an-outstanding-healthcare-experience-and-solving-top-industry-challenges-start-with-integrated-engagement-strategy/">How we build trust</a> around every interaction is critical. Because consumerism is going to happen, <a href="https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.17.0558" target="_blank" rel="noopener">value-based care</a> is going to happen. And consumers are going to gravitate to those they trust. We&rsquo;re very privileged to be a part of creating that trust.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to continue the conversation with John and Steve, please&nbsp;<a href="/contact/">reach out</a> and we&rsquo;ll schedule some time to make a connection.</p>

							<p><strong style="color: #2c363f; font-size: 20px;">Part 1: Accreditations and Certifications</strong></p><p><em>If you&rsquo;re looking to improve the patient/member service experience at your health plan or health system, an improved centralized support center is a foundational starting point. But as the industry deals with </em><a href="https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/human-resources/help-wanted-labor-market-vaccine-mandates-and-worker-burnout-top-healthcare-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>labor challenges</em></a><em>, </em><a href="/delivering-an-outstanding-healthcare-experience-and-solving-top-industry-challenges-start-with-integrated-engagement-strategy/"><em>changing expectations</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/health-industries/library/behind-the-numbers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>rising costs</em></a><em> (including&nbsp; technology and equipment)</em><em>, many organizations are rethinking whether they should build or rebuild their own contact center, or find a partner with innovative solutions and the core competencies they need.</em></p><p><em>To provide you with a few insights for that decision, this new blog series from </em><a href="/"><em>Carenet Health</em></a><em> looks at relevant factors to consider. In this first post in the series, we examine accreditations and certifications. </em></p><p>In deciding how to source and staff your healthcare contact center operations, one important element to consider is that some vendors will be able to offer accredited, certified solutions; some will be able to offer limited certifications or none; and even your own patient contact center (or health plan member contact center) will likely lack objective accreditations and certifications on its own.</p><p>For example, at Carenet Health, we are both <a href="https://www.urac.org/accreditation-cert/health-call-center-accreditation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">URAC-accredited</a> and have a <a href="https://www.ncqa.org/programs/health-plans/health-information-products-hip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Health Information Product Certification</a> from the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA).</p><p>The <a href="https://www.urac.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">URAC</a> accreditation includes standards for clinical staff qualifications, training and roles of non-clinical staff, telephone performance thresholds, response times, handling of triage calls, information sharing, feedback to physicians and more. Meeting these standards is a sure pathway to <a href="/rebuilding-the-healthcare-consumer-experience-with-a-focus-on-trust-satisfaction/">building consumer trust</a>.</p><p>Could you meet these same standards by training your own staff and developing more detailed policies and compliance standards? Yes, but doing so would typically require a significant investment of time and resources.</p><p>If you decide to go with a healthcare contact center vendor, you&rsquo;ll want to verify that the service and support solution has the URAC accreditation and the <a href="https://www.ncqa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NCQA</a> certification. Not all of them do.&nbsp;In fact, <a href="/about/accreditations-and-awards/">Carenet Health</a> is <a href="https://reportcards.ncqa.org/other-health-care-organization/Other_001G000001uwt4XIAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of only 20 organizations</a> with the NCQA Health Information Product Certification, and even fewer vendors have both accreditations.</p><h5><strong>Do certification and accreditation really matter?</strong></h5><p>Yes. You can be more confident in a service when an independent and objective third party has rigorously and comprehensively examined its systems, protocols and performance.</p><p>For example, URAC&rsquo;s health call center accreditation requires that the call center vendor meet 40 specific core standards across the following areas:</p><ul><li>Organizational structure</li><li>Policies and procedures</li><li>Regulatory compliance</li><li>Delegated functions</li><li>Marketing and sales</li><li>Information management</li><li>Quality management</li><li>Staffing and oversight</li><li>Consumer rights, safety and satisfaction</li></ul><p>These comprehensive standards mean that URAC-accredited health call centers are best-in-class operations that few insourced call centers can match.</p><p>In addition, vendors that seek and maintain certifications and accreditations continuously enhance their quality of service&mdash;in part because they have to. For example, organizations with the NCQA Health Information Product Certification undergo an assessment against NCQA standards at least every two years. Thus, these organizations must constantly improve their offerings to comply with the continually evolving NCQA standards.</p><h5><strong>What are the benefits of embracing the new consumer-centric focus in healthcare?</strong></h5><p>Most hospital and payer executives are now <a href="https://medcitynews.com/2020/02/where-providers-and-payers-stand-on-consumerism-value-based-care-and-healthcare-transformation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taking steps</a> to provide more consumer-centric healthcare. Why is that? Because a consumer focus makes financial sense. In particular, improving your consumer engagement leads to better<a href="/beyond_a_healthcare_call_center/"> patient outcomes and reduced costs</a>.</p><p>(Learn more about how Carenet Health is providing insights into the <a href="/carenet-health-launches-cx-analytics-capability-to-help-payers-and-providers-optimize-the-healthcare-service-journey/">healthcare-specific consumer service journey and experience</a>.)</p><h5><strong>Other considerations for build vs. buy relating to health plan member or patient support</strong></h5><p>Be sure to check back on our blog for new articles in this series.

							<p>Carenet Health <a href="/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">Nurse Triage and Advice Line solutions</a> leverage the best-in-class <a href="https://www.stcc-triage.com/the-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schmitt-Thompson&reg; Clinical Content</a> to guide the care recommendations of our registered nurses (RNs). The world&rsquo;s leading healthcare organizations rely on Schmitt-Thompson Clinical Content to ensure clinical safety and consistency of responses to symptom-based questions.</p><p>Recently, Schmitt-Thompson announced it has added evidence-based telehealth dispositions to its content. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidthompsonmd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Thompson, MD, FACEP</a>, and Senior Medical Editor for the organization, discussed the additions on LinkedIn recently. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/schmitt-thompson-clinical-content_telehealth-triage-telemedicine-activity-6818191517618909184-Odu8?utm_source=linkedin_share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read about it here.</a></p><p>The updated guidelines provide detailed recommendations for our RNs on which types of patient conditions and symptoms are suitable candidates for a virtual consult with a physician. Both adult and pediatric telehealth triage guidelines have been updated and include &ldquo;decision logic to support a hand-off from nurse telehealth triage to a telemedicine encounter.&rdquo; (Source:&nbsp;Schmitt-Thompson Clinical Content Update, <em>Adult and Peds After-Hours Telehealth Triage Guidelines)</em></p><p><strong>This change will benefit both patients and Carenet Health clients. </strong></p><p>Recommending that a patient consider a <a href="/whats-on-the-horizon-for-telehealth-four-trends-to-watch/">telehealth visit</a> based on clinical evidence will help the patient receive the most appropriate level of care in the most convenient and cost-effective way. In many cases, that can mean the comfort of their own home with a telemedicine visit from their provider during normal clinic hours or from a 24/7, on-demand provider.</p><p>In instances where our nurse triage/advice solutions are seamlessly connected by contract to telemedicine providers (such as <a href="https://www.mdlive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MDLive</a>), the telehealth visit can be initiated in a near-real time hand-off if a member has that benefit as part of their plan. This would also be the case if a client leverages our streamlined, consumer-centric <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ede72eec-c91b-43cb-a8fe-2dd7c30495d4.pdf">Virtual Clinic</a>.</p><p>In addition, the change supports the <a href="/rebuilding-the-healthcare-consumer-experience-with-a-focus-on-trust-satisfaction/">building of trust and patient/health plan member confidence</a>. A disposition that is telemedicine-eligible means that the patient can be assured that their symptoms can be safely evaluated and managed in a video telemedicine encounter without having to visit another site of care.</p><p>Of course, as with all of our telehealth nurse recommendations, the decision to suggest a telemedicine visit to any particular patient will ultimately be based on our experienced nurses&rsquo; judgment, patient safety and needs, and <a href="/">Carenet Health</a> and client policies.</p><p>If your organization would like to discuss these new, evidence-based guidelines and how they could impact your health plan or health system, please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> today.</p>

							<p>SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, March 8, 2022 &mdash; Carenet Health has announced the launch of the industry&rsquo;s first healthcare-dedicated Service Journey CX Analytics Group. The group is made up of a team with 100+ years of combined experience that has generated more than 250 comprehensive Service Journey studies for a range of industries, including technology, e-commerce and financial services. Foundational to Carenet&rsquo;s value, the team will be applying this collective operational expertise and proven methodologies exclusively to the patient and health plan member experience.</p><p>Carenet Health Chief Executive Officer John Erwin said the group&rsquo;s capabilities focus on rigorous customer service optimization and are designed to peel back the complex layers of the healthcare service journey. This comes at a time when the impact of consumer satisfaction on health plans and providers is growing.</p><p>&ldquo;Payers and providers are being affected by experience measures in new ways, from healthcare consumerism to the revenue associated with CAHPS and CMS Star ratings. In the past, they haven&rsquo;t had much insight beyond standard surveying and contact center reports,&rdquo; Erwin said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to help fill that void.&rdquo;</p><p>The group&rsquo;s initial offering, called Insight Analytics, combines statistical sampling, human observational analytics and calibrated listening to generate thousands of data points from just one healthcare service interaction. Carenet&rsquo;s Vice President of CX Analytics Bo Young has been developing and implementing customer experience analytics programs for 20+ years and is leading the group and launch.</p><p>&ldquo;Our approach allows us to dig deep into not only what happens during a patient or health plan member interaction&mdash;whether that&rsquo;s a text, email, chat or live phone call&mdash;but also identify points of friction before and after a healthcare service engagement,&rdquo; Young said.</p><p>Young also said that similar projects have produced results that include a 35% or more increase in customer satisfaction, 40% reduction in average call handle time and automation of over 50% of team member tasks during a consumer interaction.</p><p>Future professional service offerings will include: Service Journey Automation Analytics, Case Management Analytics, Industry Benchmarking, Analytics as a Service (AaaS), and Data Labeling/AI Analytics.</p><p style="text-align: center;">###</p><p><em>CAHPS, which stands for the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems, and the Stars programs are part of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.</em></p><p><strong>About Carenet Health&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Carenet Health is one of the healthcare industry&rsquo;s leading consumer engagement and telehealth partners&mdash;providing member and patient engagement, clinical support, virtual care and advocacy solutions on behalf of 250+ of the nation&rsquo;s premier health plans, providers, health systems and Fortune 500 companies.

							<p>Consumers are beginning to expect better healthcare experiences. And we know that delivering those experiences can support improved outcomes, increased revenue and lowered costs. But the fact is, you can&rsquo;t achieve those goals without successful <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">consumer engagement</a>.</p><p>We recently sat down with John Erwin, <a href="/about/meet-the-team/">Carenet Health CEO</a>, to explore this topic further, including how specific engagement strategies can serve as vital bridges between consumers and the healthcare ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Q: Let&rsquo;s start with the big picture. Healthcare consumerism is a hot topic&mdash;and CMS, health plans and providers all seem to be focusing more on consumer satisfaction. Where does </strong><a href="/defining-health-plan-member-engagement-what-does-it-really-mean/"><strong>healthcare engagement</strong></a><strong> fit into that conversation?</strong></p><p>A: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/debgordon/2021/12/02/is-the-era-of-healthcare-consumerism-finally-here-new-survey-says-yes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumerism in healthcare</a>. Health plan members and patients became more aware of their choices, whether it&rsquo;s a telehealth versus in-office visit, at-home lab work or making an appointment by text. There&rsquo;s an ample supply of disruptors who want to capitalize on those changing consumer expectations. So healthcare organizations are rethinking long-held paradigms, and that includes how they engage with their members and patients &hellip; and what the typical consumer&rsquo;s service journey looks like.</p><p>They&rsquo;re realizing that consumer connections and support, regardless of what channel they&rsquo;re happening in and when they&rsquo;re happening, are critical building blocks of the healthcare experience. Each engagement touchpoint is a fuel for satisfaction. And responding to consumerism means improving how you engage with those you serve and those you want to serve in the future.</p><p><strong>Q: You&rsquo;re also a big proponent of leveraging healthcare engagement to help solve key industry challenges. A significant one we&rsquo;re facing now is the </strong><a href="https://www.modernhealthcare.com/finance/healthcare-costs-projected-increase-65-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>deferred care crisis</strong></a><strong> brought on by the pandemic. How important is consumer engagement to getting a handle on this problem?</strong></p><p><strong>A: </strong>Closing preventive and treatment care gaps has always been a challenge, but it&rsquo;s a bigger issue today&mdash;Americans of all ages have put off care and screenings. I see convenience and choice as two factors that will be instrumental in helping people make and keep their appointments.</p><p>From a convenience standpoint, consumers expect to access care when and where they want it, including from the comfort of home. The range of virtual and <a href="/how-to-address-the-deferred-care-crisis-in-home-care-for-starters/">at-home care options</a> will be important for organizations to offer when reaching out to patients and plan members.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also essential to implement a tech-enabled, <a href="/how-strong-is-your-contact-strategy-for-outbound-healthcare-engagement/">multichannel approach to that outreach</a>, because we know that using more channels <a href="https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/closing-gaps-in-care-improving-patient-outcomes-and-revenue-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outperforms the use of single channels</a> by as much as 300%. And we know from our work at Carenet that the right engagement teams, with the right <a href="/hedis-engagement-root-causes-of-appointment-refusals-and-how-to-change-a-no-to-a-yes/">understanding of appointment refusals</a>, using the right channels, can generate at least three times the return on investment. We should also be asking healthcare consumers how they want to engage&mdash;and then deliver information, service and care how they want it.</p><p><strong> Q: Telehealth boomed during the pandemic, and patients, providers and payers experienced the benefits. But now utilization is dropping. How can we keep that momentum going with consumer engagement?&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>A: </strong>One of the most interesting concepts we&rsquo;re seeing is the need for a digital front door to support <a href="/whats-on-the-horizon-for-telehealth-four-trends-to-watch/">telehealth use</a>. We have to realize that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/debgordon/2021/02/08/health-insurance-confusion-continues-to-plague-americans-new-data-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare can be confusing</a>, and even taking the first steps can feel overwhelming to consumers. A digital front door can simplify the experience, giving individuals a single starting point&mdash;one phone number, one digital place&mdash;where they can start engaging with their plan or provider. From there, consumers can be routed to general support services, registered nurses for advice and symptom triage, live virtual physician consults for situations that require an MD, behavioral health assistance &hellip; or whatever support fits their needs best. But it all starts with <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/96bd98cf-b18f-4476-a7ce-78a5c47f9898.pdf">streamlined engagement</a> that helps them navigate the ecosystem and guides them to telehealth as an option.</p><p><strong>Q: <a href="/remote-patient-monitoring-program-improving-care-comfort-and-costs/">Remote patient monitoring</a> and hospital-at-home care have advanced considerably. How do you see patient engagement playing a more impactful role moving forward?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Engagement can be used to pique consumer interest in digital health monitoring, motivate patients to enroll in remote care programs, and encourage action and follow-through. In fact, we think that upfront engagement is really going to be critical to laying the groundwork for long-term RPM success. Frankly, well-designed patient engagement is missing in a lot of initiatives right now. AI-driven communications and other innovations can be leveraged, absolutely, but we can&rsquo;t lose sight of the importance of both human and digital interaction for trust-building, troubleshooting, problem-solving and coaching.</p><p><strong>Q: It&rsquo;s no secret that health inequities exist and addressing social determinants of health continues to be a challenge. How can we approach engagement differently to work toward solving this issue?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> This is another area where we have to anchor our digital work with one-on-one human interactions. For instance, let&rsquo;s use text messages to get conversations started, to introduce risk assessments and surveying that engages about potential needs. Then let&rsquo;s deploy trained engagement specialists to build relationships that can be transitioned back to digital for removing care obstacles and initiating next steps or connecting with resources. Telehealth can also be a powerful tool for addressing <a href="/eight-ways-to-optimize-patient-engagement-to-address-social-determinants-of-health/">social determinants of health</a>&mdash;one that&rsquo;s underused.</p><p>Actually, to bring it back full circle, addressing social determinants&mdash;like so many of the industry&rsquo;s challenges&mdash;means using all of the tools we have to address the consumer&rsquo;s desire for service, convenience, simplicity and choice.</p><p>That&rsquo;s the mindset the healthcare industry needs today&mdash;thinking in a more retail-oriented, consumer-centric way that creates outstanding experiences while driving the revenue and cost-efficiencies that providers and payers need to succeed.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>To learn more about the value of using one-on-one engagement to address healthcare&rsquo;s challenges, <a href="/exploring-the-value-of-one-on-one-consumer-engagement-in-addressing-healthcares-top-concerns/">download our white paper</a>.

							<p>Smart Medicare Advantage (MA) plans are laser-focused on their CMS Stars patient experience scores.&nbsp;Typically, improving those experience scores comes down to at least these elements:</p><ul><li>Retaining your Medicare Advantage members and preventing <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Eligibility-and-Enrollment/MedicareMangCareEligEnrol/Downloads/CY_2019_MA_Enrollment_and_Disenrollment_Guidance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">member disenrollment</a></li><li>Limiting and solving for member complaints and dissatisfaction</li><li>Preemptively surveying and improving general satisfaction measured by the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Research/CAHPS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CAHPS survey</a></li><li>Empowering your teams and providers to form nurturing relationships with members</li></ul><p>Below, we break down four proactive strategies for MA plans to consider as they work on their improvement initiatives&mdash;including some strategies plans may not have considered yet.</p><p><strong>Idea #1: &nbsp;</strong><strong>Identify those members at risk for negative scores and offer them concierge-level service</strong></p><p>The best way to begin neutralizing negative ratings is to target individual members who have indicated potential dissatisfaction with strategic communication. This population can be determined using analysis of data from ongoing NPS (net promoter score) surveying, narrow-network ZIP codes and official complaints.</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve found your audience, consider offering these members a multichannel, <a href="/what-we-do/advocacy-solutions/">concierge-level service program</a>. The program should provide one-on-one connections that:</p><ul><li>Assist members with all of their healthcare and benefits problem-solving</li><li>Actively listen to concerns</li><li>Engage in a strategic cadence that ensures relationship- and trust-building</li><li>Demonstrate empathy and the plan&rsquo;s commitment to service</li></ul><p>Here is an example of how that could look in practice:</p>

							<p>For examples of advocacy programs in action, <a href="/what-does-health-plan-member-advocacy-look-like-in-action/">check out this blog post</a>.</p><p><strong>Idea #2: &nbsp;Adopt holistic engagement strategies that include mental health for all members</strong></p><p>The pandemic has hit Americans&rsquo; mental health hard. With <a href="https://press.aarp.org/2020-10-7-Foundation-Social-Isolation-Pandemic-Report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two-thirds of adults suffering from social isolation</a>, issues like depression and anxiety are affecting people&rsquo;s well-being in greater numbers than ever before. The mental health of your senior population affects a lot&mdash;physical health outcomes, quality of life &hellip; and <a href="/best-practices-for-5-star-health-plan-member-engagement/">satisfaction with your plan</a>.</p><p>So, it makes sense that health plans that provide whole-person care with an increased focus on mental health may achieve better outcomes and higher Star ratings. At <a href="/">Carenet Health</a>, we recommend developing programs that target both mental health crises and maintenance support, as well as help members access local social services.</p><p>Another important step should be educating your members about the resources you offer, whether that&rsquo;s <a href="/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">24/7 nurse triage</a> or virtual counseling sessions. Be sure to clearly communicate the costs associated with the support offered and any self-help tools members can use. Remember to <a href="/one-on-one-check-ins-are-engagement-lifesavers-for-seniors-during-the-pandemic/">check in on members periodically</a>.</p>						
				
				
				
							<p>Telehealth, including virtual behavioral health care, can impact a number of Star ratings, as well. And chances are, it&rsquo;s being underused as an improvement tool by your Medicare Advantage plan. <a href="/an-overlooked-strategy-how-on-demand-telehealth-can-unlock-better-star-ratings/">Read more about that here</a>.</p>						
				
				
				
							<p><strong>Idea #3: &nbsp;Pay more attention to getting better at provider-payer engagement</strong></p><p>The fact remains that a majority of a Medicare Advantage plan&rsquo;s Star ratings can be linked to what happens or doesn&rsquo;t happen between patients and providers. Health plans should have a process in place to reach out to providers to establish connections, coordinate care and seamlessly manage referrals.</p><p>But importantly, beyond that, does your organization have a plan to measure the success of that process? Can you identify, in near-real time, areas that need improvement? Can you implement optimizations quickly?</p><p>In the past, provider-payer engagement hasn&rsquo;t had the same headline appeal as direct-to-consumer engagement, with all its bells and whistles. But it deserves a strategy for continuous improvement.</p><p><strong>Idea #4: &nbsp;Take member surveying to the next level&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Year-round, frequent member surveys can help your plan measure patient experiences and inform next steps for addressing any issues the surveys may reveal. Now is a good time to unpack and review your:</p><ul><li>Surveying tactics,</li><li>Channels,</li><li>Scripts, and</li><li>Partners</li></ul><p>&mdash;and find areas that could use a refresh.</p><p>Just one example: What happens during a surveying call when a member has a complaint? Is that member immediately warm-transferred to someone who can address their concern? The same question should be asked when you&rsquo;re using a portal survey tool or a survey sent via text.</p><p>Another way to build on a frequent surveying strategy is to develop member sentiment analysis that correlates findings to specific provider groups, demographic groups and/or geographic areas&mdash;so that you can identify where your best opportunities lie in improving member satisfaction and experience.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like more ideas and strategy planning templates for designing your Medicare Advantage member satisfaction improvement initiatives, download our <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/975c3546-829d-43ef-bbde-6ae1d8a379f8.pdf">Stars Planning Toolkit</a>.</p>

							<h5>Patients Are Gravitating to New Players in the Healthcare Industry</h5><p>There&rsquo;s a looming threat to the healthcare industry that needs to be addressed. Offering lower prices and quick care options, retail clinics and non-traditional healthcare players are hard for healthcare consumers to resist. Now is the time to take matters into your own hands to ensure you continue to attract new patients and keep your market share.</p><p>Retail clinics and non-traditional healthcare players are playing to their strengths right now&mdash;low costs, brand recognition, and well-established operations and logistics. While it seems like they may have it all together, they&rsquo;re also facing quite a challenge at the moment&mdash;building trust with healthcare consumers. Despite having brand recognition and a loyal following, they lack empathy and trust, which are needed in healthcare.</p><h5>How to Compete with Retail Clinics and Non-Traditional Healthcare Players</h5><p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, your health system is not going to win when it comes to price, but there are other strategies you can utilize to retain your current patient population and attract new patients. For your health system to combat the onslaught of new entrants, you must ensure a seamless patient experience. Here are four strategies to improve your patient experience and beat out retail clinics.</p><h5>Utilize an Online Scheduling Solution to Prioritize Convenience</h5><p>Patients want the convenience and ability to schedule an appointment at your healthcare facility today. When you provide patients with the digital infrastructure to schedule appointments quickly and with multiple time slots, you can be much more competitive.</p><p>Your health system can create this type of experience by utilizing an<a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/best-practices-in-patient-scheduling-for-healthcare-marketers/" rel="noopener"> online patient scheduling solution.</a> Consider also providing contactless check-in and payment or virtual waiting rooms to further improve your patient experience and minimize the amount of time patients must spend in your office.</p><p>In addition, an online scheduling solution allows you to triage patients before they arrive based on their self-reported symptoms. Even more, your health system can direct them to the best venue of care based on their symptoms.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p>For example, if a patient specifies that they are having trouble breathing as one of their symptoms, you can alert the patient to seek their closest emergency department rather than scheduling an appointment with their physician.</p></blockquote><h5>Provide Personalized Patient Communications</h5><p>Personalized patient care can set you apart from retail clinics and non-traditional healthcare players. Patients are accustomed to receiving personalized information and recommendations in their daily routines. Your health system can create <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/best-practices-in-patient-scheduling-for-healthcare-marketers">personalized patient communications</a> by tailoring your messaging to their profile data&mdash;including demographic information, medical history, and patient preference. Even more, you can use non-patient-specific details such as appointment type, location, cost, and more either independently or in conjunction with patient information to customize content, communication channels, cadence, and context.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p>For example, <strong>Netflix</strong> provides customized suggestions on what to watch based on your individual interests, and fitness wearables provide physical activity recommendations based on tracked lifestyle habits. Patients expect this same type of personalized communications from their providers.</p></blockquote><h5>Create an Efficient Referral Management Process</h5><p>Retail clinics may shine in episodic care but tend to fall short when considering the entire patient journey. Without access to a patient&rsquo;s full medical history or the ready ability to speak with referring physicians, retail clinics lose sight of the continuum of care and the patient&rsquo;s full spectrum of health.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p>For example, if a patient visits a retail clinic for flu-like symptoms and their flu and strep test come back negative, it&rsquo;s likely the physician will tell the patient to follow up with their primary care physician. In situations like this, the retail clinic adds another step in the patient&rsquo;s journey, which can become frustrating for the patient.</p></blockquote><p>Your health system can create an efficient referral management process and retain patients by utilizing an <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/best-practices-in-patient-scheduling-for-healthcare-marketers/">online patient scheduling solution.</a> By doing so, you ensure that patients are proactively escalated to their next step of care and engaged in managing their health. They&rsquo;ll know that they are seeing higher quality care than they would at a retail clinic. Even more, your staff doesn&rsquo;t have the burden of managing referrals, which means they have more time to complete other tasks.</p><h5>Continue to Innovate to Deliver Higher Patient Satisfaction</h5><p>Your health system should frequently map your patient journey to identify areas that you can reduce or remove friction. By doing so, you create an opportunity to become creative and offer a more innovative patient experience.</p><blockquote class="blog-quote"><p>For example, healthcare consumers are drawn to retail clinicsbecause of their ability to provide care during non-working hours. To compete, consider offering early morning, late, or even virtual visits to accommodate today&rsquo;s busy healthcare consumers.</p></blockquote><p>Reputation is everything, and the best way to keep patients loyal is by asking patients for feedback after their appointment. Consider sending patient surveys so your organization can know if patients are or are not pleased with their experience. Knowing this information will allow you to improve the areas that may be lacking and better understand what you are doing well.</p><p>Healthcare consumers have no patience for sub-optimal experiences. It&rsquo;s time for health systems to improve the patient experience to make the patient journey more consumer friendly. If you&rsquo;re unsure where to start, consider implementing one strategy, such as online scheduling.</p>

							<p>There&rsquo;s no question telehealth is now mainstream. It&rsquo;s convenient, safe and supports healthcare cost-savings. It also provides an opportunity for the industry to expand access to care and <a href="/to-meet-new-consumer-expectations-rethink-your-approach-to-patient-access-and-service-navigation/">provide a better healthcare consumer experience</a>.</p><p>But what&rsquo;s next? Consumer <a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2022/01/05/telehealth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">utilization of virtual care has decreased</a> and the boom era of growth has stabilized. How will <a href="https://mhealthintelligence.com/features/how-telehealth-will-continue-its-evolution-beyond-pandemic-response" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtual care continue to evolve</a> and deliver on its promises?</p><p>As a starting point, we&rsquo;ve rounded up several insights from our <a href="/">Carenet Health</a> experts that illustrate how we think telehealth will transition and eventually mature in the coming months.</p><p><strong>First: When it comes to on-demand, 24/7 telehealth services, the check-the-box approach must evolve.</strong></p><p>To spur continued growth, <a href="/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">telehealth</a> is going to need to evolve into a true digital front door that modernizes the healthcare experience for all. Optimizing and enhancing telehealth options so they work across the healthcare ecosystem should be top of mind for payers and providers today.</p><p>There&rsquo;s increasing interest in using registered nurses to triage virtual care first, to free up e-consult physicians and <a href="/revisiting-the-role-of-nurses-in-telehealth-three-ways-they-can-make-an-immediate-impact/">provide efficient care at a lower cost</a>.</p><p>Taking a virtual-first approach for preventive and primary care&mdash;one that could even begin with a call to a nurse triage center&mdash;may also inspire change. Not only could this strategy relieve overburdened in-person care settings, but it also has the potential to streamline costs beyond <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/how-to-improve-your-health-plans-er-diversion-strategy">preventing or diverting emergency department (ED) visits.</a></p><p>Behavioral health has already seen <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/telehealth-a-quarter-trillion-dollar-post-covid-19-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher levels of telehealth adoption</a>, with the topmost penetration in psychiatry (50%) and substance use treatment (30%). Establishing virtual clinics that offer <a href="/one-stop-behavioral-health-crisis-support-delivers-95-ed-diversion/">mental health crisis care without a referral</a>&mdash;and speeding time to receiving care&mdash;is an idea that&rsquo;s gaining ground. Emergency telemedicine and physical teletherapy are two other areas we expect to begin to really lean into telehealth.</p><p>Perhaps most exciting, telehealth stands to become a more powerful connector. During a single visit, practitioners and physicians could use telehealth to have all members of a care team present at the same time with a patient. For chronic care management, telemedicine visits could also expand a care team&rsquo;s ability to communicate with patients when they need care during evenings and weekends.</p><p><strong>Next: Better consumer education, assistance and connectivity are necessary to sustain telehealth growth.</strong></p><p>While more people than ever before are comfortable using telehealth, paying attention to trends among different populations will help ensure adoption. A healthcare consumer&rsquo;s age, gender, whether they live in a rural or more urban setting&mdash;all of these factors will come into play as the healthcare ecosystem relies more on telehealth in the future.</p><p>To keep the momentum going, payers, providers and telehealth partners will need to work together to support and <a href="/an-overlooked-strategy-how-on-demand-telehealth-can-unlock-better-star-ratings/">educate healthcare consumers about virtual care options</a>.</p><p>Leveraging automated and AI-driven messaging and <a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">personalized engagement</a> will help bridge the gap between interest and successful use of telehealth by seniors, underserved populations and rural residents. <a href="/rebuilding-the-healthcare-consumer-experience-with-a-focus-on-trust-satisfaction/">Transparency</a> will also go a long way toward building trust and satisfaction with patients.</p><p>As telehealth grows, so will questions from healthcare consumers. In addition to one-on-one engagement tactics, placing engagement coordinators or registered nurses at the digital front door can make navigating options easier and more efficient.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>Read more about these trends and learn about two additional telehealth trends to watch by downloading our trend brief, <a href="/whats-on-the-horizon-for-telehealth-four-trends-to-watch/"><em>What&rsquo;s on the Horizon for Telehealth?

							<p>When it comes to the ripple effects of deferred care, all signs point to an unsettling fact: The crisis doesn&rsquo;t appear to be subsiding any time soon. The good news is that the mainstays of the COVID-19 pandemic&mdash;staying home, working from home&mdash;have also led to an acceleration in the use of digital health tools and <a href="/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">telehealth care</a> interactions, and healthcare consumers appear more comfortable than ever with receiving care from home.</p><p>That makes the <a href="/trend-watch-as-in-home-healthcare-services-grow-patient-engagement-becomes-even-more-important/">utilization of in-home care</a> a promising strategy for helping patients catch up on the care they&rsquo;ve delayed. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look.</p><p><strong>Reviewing the deferred care crisis</strong></p><p>As COVID-19 overwhelmed the healthcare system, providers put non-essential care on hold. Patients postponed traveling to doctors&rsquo; offices for vision, dental and physical checkups. Screening tests, chronic condition care and even surgical procedures were delayed. That put patients behind the eight ball in terms of timely diagnoses and treatments&mdash;leading them down the path to increased health problems and even death.</p><ul><li>Since the start of the pandemic, <a href="https://www.huronconsultinggroup.com/insights/healthcare-consumer-market-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 40% of U.S. healthcare consumers have postponed care</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/10/14/1043414558/with-hospitals-crowded-from-covid-1-in-5-american-families-delays-health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One in every five households</a> has recently delayed care for serious illnesses, including diabetes, hypertension and heart disease.</li><li>Breast and cervical cancer screening tests <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/preventive-medicine/vol/151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped more than 80%,</a> according to the National Breast and Cervical Cancer early detection program.</li><li>Over the next 10 years, <a href="https://www.hfma.org/topics/financial-sustainability/article/the-crisis-within-the-crisis--preparing-for-the-wave-of-covid-19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 10,000 additional deaths from breast and colorectal cancer could be attributed to decreased screening</a> and prevention during the pandemic, predicts the director of the National Cancer Institute.</li></ul><p><strong>The time is right for in-home care engagement</strong></p><p>The outlook isn&rsquo;t all discouraging, though. Remote care is poised to start closing the <a href="/how-to-motivate-the-medicare-population-to-schedule-appointments-close-care-gaps/">care gaps</a>&mdash;and consumers appear ready for it. During the pandemic, many patients were forced to use <a href="/remote-patient-monitoring-program-improving-care-comfort-and-costs/">remote monitoring</a> and <a href="/tag/telehealth/">telehealth</a> and, in general, they&rsquo;ve liked it. And three-quarters of consumers surveyed by the <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/health-industries/library/hri-insight-consumer-health-behavior-and-covid-19-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PwC Health Research Institute</a> said they were willing to get in-home care for needs ranging from a well visit to chronic disease management.</p><p>Plus, there&rsquo;s solid science backing the effectiveness of in-home care. In randomized studies, patients receiving in-home care had lower mortality rates and an overall <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/hospitals-health-systems/unitedhealth-study-administering-specialty-drugs-outside-hospital-could" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better patient experience</a> than those cared for in-hospital.</p><p><strong>Multi-modal in-home care can help overcome patient barriers</strong></p><p>Of course, more factors are driving the deferred care crisis than the pandemic alone. Lack of transportation, mobility or childcare, for instance, can prevent patients from scheduling appointments or lead to cancellations. In-home care options offer an obvious solution for these patients&mdash;and provide convenience even for people who simply find it hard to fit office visits into their schedules.</p><p>Healthcare cost is an ongoing issue for many consumers, and in-home care can help here, too. For example, administering specialty drugs in patients&rsquo; homes instead of an outpatient setting can <a href="https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/content/dam/UHG/PDF/2019/UHG-Administered-Specialty-Drugs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce the cost by $16,000 to $37,000 per patient per year</a>. Another example: One study found that <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/newsletter-article/hospital-home-programs-improve-outcomes-lower-costs-face-resistance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hospital-at-home programs</a> can result in a 30% reduction in the cost of care while ensuring patient comfort.</p><p>As technology advances, in-home care offers an increasing number of options for providers and patients to pursue the kinds of care once only available in an onsite capacity, such as:</p><ul><li>Hospital-at-home programs</li><li>Imaging and other diagnostics, including lab testing</li><li>Modern house-calls for wellness visits</li><li>Mental and behavioral health service</li><li>Voice- and sensory-activated remote monitoring</li><li>Medication reconciliation</li><li>Nutrition support</li><li>Preventive care and screening test kits</li></ul><p>The methods for offering in-home care are likewise growing and expanding. Here&rsquo;s a glimpse of a few solutions available today:</p><ul><li><strong>In-person home visits by clinicians. </strong>Many medical conditions are suited to this approach, from a basic wellness exam to a blood pressure check to post-recovery treatment.</li><li><strong>Phone calls, text messages and mobile apps. </strong>A strategic combination of <a href="/even-in-a-digital-world-human-to-human-phone-engagement-remains-critical-in-healthcare/">telephone conversation</a>s and text messaging can deliver excellent results in <a href="/whats-new-in-closing-gaps-in-care-and-what-still-works/">closing care gaps</a> and could be useful in scheduling at-home care. (Seventy percent (<a href="/gap-closing-strategies-for-medicare-plans-todays-tips-from-the-field/">70%) member activation rates</a> have been achieved when calls are paired with text-based engagement solutions.) Mobile apps are also gaining ground for building in-home patient engagement. Finding the right medium and the most effective cadence will require testing and patient input; it&rsquo;s important to ask people for their communication preferences and honor their response.</li><li><strong>In-home testing and screening.</strong> While at-home COVID-19 testing is becoming more common, it&rsquo;s hardly the first use of in-home screening kits. Used for several years now, data shows that in-home kits are an easy, safe way to conduct certain types of preventive screening, such as for diabetic testing and even colon cancer screening.</li></ul><p><strong>In-home care and patient engagement in 2022 </strong></p><p>As effective as in-home care can be for addressing the deferred care crisis, challenges loom. For instance, while consumers are increasingly comfortable with taking more responsibility for their own care, not everyone has the same level of confidence. According to a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/consumer-health-trends.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> by Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, 48% of Gen Z and millennials&mdash;versus 28% of seniors&mdash;say they feel confident using at-home blood tests, while half of all consumers are comfortable using at-home diagnostics.</p><p>The key to overcoming many challenges will be patient healthcare engagement. As <a href="/about/meet-the-team/">Carenet Health CEO John Erwin</a> has said, &ldquo;The solutions are there, the partnerships are there or emerging, but they&rsquo;re not well-activated yet &hellip; the engagement need is huge, especially as the industry works on addressing social determinants of health.&rdquo;</p><p>This will require new relationship-building strategies. In just about every type of remote patient monitoring situation, consumer and clinical healthcare engagement is needed to help with adoption, activation, utilization encouragement, and ongoing monitoring and follow-up.</p><p>In-home patient engagement starts with understanding the causes behind both a patient&rsquo;s personal obstacles to care&mdash;such as lack of transportation or fear of virus exposure&mdash;and any hesitancy surrounding in-home care options. Once these foundational concerns are known, engagement teams&mdash;including care coordinators, registered nurses and online physician consults&mdash;can provide education and information to help put patients at ease.</p><p>As part of <a href="/eight-ways-to-optimize-patient-engagement-to-address-social-determinants-of-health/">optimizing in-home patient engagement</a>, healthcare professionals must be able to speak in plain language, not jargon. They should have training in empathy, age sensitivity and cultural sensitivity. And they should be prepared to use these interactions to explore health concerns beyond the patient&rsquo;s specific need at that moment and gather information to further personalize this and future interactions.</p><p>Another piece of the puzzle will be assessing your existing processes and procedures to remove friction and create positive in-home patient experiences. Consider what does (and should) happen at each touchpoint and how each connection could be made easier, more convenient or more patient-friendly. Brainstorm ways to add value. Use these ideas to <a href="/to-meet-new-consumer-expectations-rethink-your-approach-to-patient-access-and-service-navigation/">rethink and refine your approach to in-home care</a>.</p><p><strong>An opportunity to manage the deferred care crisis</strong></p><p>As consumers have become more accustomed to the use of digital health tools, in-home care is strongly positioned to help close the care gap&mdash;improving assessment and adherence, reducing cost and ultimately improving patient health.</p><p>Download the complete <a href="/carenet-healths-2022-healthcare-consumer-engagement-forecast-free-to-download/">2022 Healthcare Consumer Engagement Forecast</a> for more details on this and six other healthcare predictions for 2022.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to speak with our healthcare consumer engagement experts about in-home care or other outreach and inbound support needs, <a href="/contact/">please reach out</a>.</p>

							<p>It&rsquo;s fairly safe to say that we all thought 2021 would look a little differently than it did. The <a href="/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 pandemic</a> continued to challenge the healthcare industry. The pandemic also continued to be a catalyst for change and innovation, including when and where care was delivered, the equity of that care and how care access was supported, how to respond to changes in patient needs and expectations, and much more.</p><p>As we look back over the past year of posts on the <a href="/resource-center/">Carenet Health blog and healthcare engagement resource center</a>, we can see a pattern that closely mirrors those changes and conversations.</p><p>See for yourself by taking a look at our top 10 blog posts of 2021 below&mdash;and catch up on the most popular reads of the year.</p>

							There&rsquo;s been a lot of buzz lately about the need to increase and improve&nbsp; <a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">health plan member engagement</a>. But before you improve it, you need to define exactly what it is you&rsquo;re working toward. So what does engagement truly mean? What does it look like in action? And how can you measure success?

The answers aren&rsquo;t as easy as they may seem. Different organizations define and measure healthcare member engagement differently, and the term is often overused.

The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/QualityInitiativesGenInfo/Person-and-Family-Engagement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</a>&nbsp;(CMS), for instance, addresses patient and family engagement (PFE) vaguely as &ldquo;proactive communication and partnered decision-making &hellip; &nbsp;building a care relationship that is based on trust and inclusion of individual values and beliefs.&rdquo;

The&nbsp;<a href="https://psnet.ahrq.gov/primer/patient-engagement-and-safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)</a>&nbsp;focuses on engagement as a way to prevent medical errors, i.e., to &ldquo;encourage patients&rsquo; active involvement in their own care as a patient safety strategy.&rdquo;

In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hpb20130214.898775/full/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Health Affairs</em>&nbsp;policy brief</a>, engagement is considered a broader concept that combines patient activation with interventions designed to promote positive patient behavior, such as obtaining preventive care or exercising regularly.

According to several Carenet Health engagement experts, when health plans talk about member engagement, it can encompass a wide range of ideas&ndash;everything from claims resolution and other customer service activities to various community or employer health initiatives and outreach.

Yet, it&rsquo;s important we all get on the same page&mdash;as a solid first step to&nbsp;<a href="/health-plan-member-satisfaction-are-you-just-an-information-provider-or-are-you-building-trust/">implementing healthcare engagement successfully</a>.

							<h2 class="blog-subhead">The Importance of a Successful Healthcare Member Engagement Strategy</h2>
<a href="/about/meet-the-team/">John Erwin</a>, CEO of Carenet, says the executives he speaks with across the industry often focus on consumer outreach when they strategize about engagement. &ldquo;There is a heightened emphasis on engagement as all of the ways an organization communicates with members and patients,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;For example, they may say, &lsquo;we touch each of our members 100 times per year,&rsquo; and this number includes all the forms of outreach with members.&rdquo;

John says the elements that are often missing in that dialogue are: Did you really make a connection with a member? Did your outreach lead to them taking a specific action?

The other perspective also growing in significance is engagement as&nbsp;<a href="/rebuilding-the-healthcare-consumer-experience-with-a-focus-on-trust-satisfaction/">customer service and member support</a>.

&ldquo;Many health plans may look at engagement as purely contextual,&rdquo; says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steveharstad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Harstad</a>, Chief Strategy Officer at Carenet. For instance, they might track:

<ul>
 	<li><strong>Digital engagement:&nbsp;</strong>Did members log in, take action with an app, or return to a site or app?</li>
 	<li><strong>Wellness engagement</strong>: Did members&nbsp;<a href="/specialized-wellness-program-enrollment-techniques-deliver-net-gain-of-7-8-million-in-one-year/">enroll in a program</a>? How many program steps did they take? How many coach/RN calls did they complete?</li>
 	<li><strong>Quality engagement</strong>: Which&nbsp;<a href="/hedis-engagement-root-causes-of-appointment-refusals-and-how-to-change-a-no-to-a-yes/">care gaps</a>&nbsp;were closed? What was the level of patient adherence? What was the number of care management program enrollments?</li>
</ul>

The truth is that regardless of how health plans define engagement, members still feel they&rsquo;re not fully succeeding. According to research from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/healthcare/commercial-member-health-plan-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J.D. Power</a>, which studies consumer member experience in a number of fields and recently surveyed nearly 35,000 members of 147 health plans throughout the U.S., insurers rank as the lowest of all industries in customer engagement.

							Overall, the J.D. Power findings showed that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/health-plans-have-consumer-engagement-problem-jd-powers-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the majority of members</a> (64%) did not feel that health plans acted in their best interest, always or even most of the time. And only one-quarter of members viewed their health plan as a trusted partner in their health and wellness.
<h2 class="blog-subhead">What health plan member engagement isn&rsquo;t</h2>
Sometimes it&rsquo;s easier to figure out what something is by understanding what it isn&rsquo;t. When we asked our leadership team to think about what member engagement should&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;be about, they provided some insights based on what they&rsquo;ve seen in the marketplace.

&ldquo;Engagement does not mean texting or emailing or web chat. Those are tactics that help you succeed in engagement, but engagement is much more than tactics,&rdquo; says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jim-caswell-74197b6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jim Caswell</a>, Director of Business Development.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-dreggors-214a7411/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Dreggors</a>, Vice President of Business Development, agrees. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not simply reaching a member&rsquo;s phone or email inbox or leaving a message without actually interacting with the member,&rdquo; he says.

It also isn&rsquo;t about how being heavy-handed in asking members to take action or overwhelming them with unwanted contact. It&rsquo;s a delicate balance of touchpoints, encouragement and action.

							<h2 class="blog-subhead">Going beyond outreach to impacts</h2>
There&rsquo;s a clear thread here. Health plans must begin measuring more than merely outreach volume. They must measure whether a valuable and meaningful conversation happened, and whether the service or support they offered made a difference to the member in terms of helping them more easily achieve a successful health outcome.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arianna-brazelton-0a96561/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arianna Brazelton</a>, Senior Client Relationship Manager, agrees with this perspective, saying, &ldquo;Engagement is really all about driving members&rsquo; utilization of the plan&rsquo;s benefit tools and services in ways that empower members to achieve better health.&rdquo;
<h2 class="blog-subhead">So, what do health plan members want? Let&rsquo;s take a look.</h2>
Perhaps most important in informing an engagement definition, health plans need to take note of what their members say they want from insurers&mdash;and then deliver on those desires.

So, what do members want? Let&rsquo;s take a look.						
				
				
				
													<img width="800" height="257" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/blog_dec-03-2048x659-2.png" class="attachment-large size-large wp-image-19063" alt="">													
				
				
				
							<p>A Verint research report,&nbsp;<a href="https://content.verint.com/vxi-health-insurance-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Experience Index: Health Insurance</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;also found that members considered factors like the value they were getting from their health plan (premium cost, level and thoroughness of coverage) as the most important factor of their overall satisfaction.</p><p>The second and third most important factors were the enrollment experience (number of plan choices and options, ease of enrollment) and the health plan&rsquo;s services (availability when needed, responsive to needs, ability to answer questions).</p><p>The level of member satisfaction is important for many reasons, but especially for becoming a trusted partner. Verint&rsquo;s research showed that satisfied members were also more likely to trust their health insurer.</p><p>Delivering customer-centric engagement requires a much different and more holistic approach than simply sending an email or responding to a web chat.</p>						
				
				
				
													<img width="800" height="257" src="https://carenethealthcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/blog_dec-05-2048x659-2.png" class="attachment-large size-large wp-image-19064" alt="">													
				
				
				
							<h2 class="blog-subhead">From buzzword to success in the real world</h2>
Targeted consumer outreach can help individuals make and keep appointments, including visits for vaccinations, preventative care and chronic disease management. And beyond that, targeted outreach should create a springboard to trust and connection.

Engagement done right will require a hard look at a health plan&rsquo;s brand promise and the specific member populations served. A Medicare audience might require a different approach than a commercial audience. Medicaid might be different by state or region or between urban versus rural.

Yet there are some factors that tend to be universal&mdash;factors that health plans should consider incorporating into member engagement efforts. These include:
<ul>
 	<li>Leveraging consumer data to help guarantee that information is personal, relevant, and timely</li>
 	<li>Providing focused, conversational messaging to move consumers to action and demonstrate you truly care</li>
 	<li>Deploying a <a href="/how-strong-is-your-contact-strategy-for-outbound-healthcare-engagement/">multi-channel, multi-touch strategy</a> built on members&rsquo; communication preferences that emphasizes awareness, education and scheduling convenience</li>
 	<li>Offering a single, simple point of contact (<a href="https://patientengagementhit.com/news/key-steps-for-opening-the-digital-front-door-digital-transformation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preferably on-demand, 24/7</a>) to make it easy for members to gain access to information and answers</li>
 	<li>Providing cost-savings and incentive programs that educate members on what their benefits are and help them use those benefits to ensure they get the most from their plan.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Taking payer member engagement to the next level</strong>

The definition of health plan member engagement may be fluid, but one factor won&rsquo;t likely change: Success requires helping members take their next-best step to health and wellness, looking beyond conventional connection metrics, and communicating with members on a deeper, more personal level&mdash;both <a href="/7-strategies-to-help-health-plans-deliver-great-member-service-even-when-staffing-cant-match-demand/">when they contact you</a>, and when you contact them.

Perhaps <a href="/rebuilding-the-healthcare-consumer-experience-with-a-focus-on-trust-satisfaction/">health plan member engagement</a>, while multi-layered, actually comes down to a single point. As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-policano-9549552/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lisa Policano</a>, Director of Business Solutions at Carenet, says, &ldquo;Sometimes, engagement can just mean doing everything in your power to build really strong relationships that result in empowered, action-taking, satisfied members.&rdquo;

							<p>The&nbsp;<a href="/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 pandemic</a> has shifted consumer expectations and behavior in just about every facet of life&mdash;from ordering groceries to conducting business meetings to scheduling appointments. Changes in the healthcare consumer experience are especially striking:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.huronconsultinggroup.com/insights/healthcare-consumer-market-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than half of consumers</a>&nbsp;say they interact with the healthcare system differently today than they did before the pandemic began.</p><p>It&rsquo;s clear patients and health plan members are&nbsp;<a href="/covid-19-is-changing-healthcare-consumer-behavior-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">empowered to demand more now</a>. They&rsquo;re more comfortable with self-service. But they also want healthcare delivered to them when, where and how they want it. Oh, and they want a streamlined, cohesive experience. And really, who can blame them?</p>

							<p>In our&nbsp;<a href="/2022-will-be-turning-point-for-healthcare-consumer-experience-according-to-forecast-from-carenet-health/">2022 Healthcare Consumer Engagement Forecast</a>, we discuss these shifts and what they really mean for improving the healthcare consumer experience, satisfaction and trust. After all, as consumers rethink what they want from their healthcare experience, those who can <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-changed-the-way-us-consumers-think-about-healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serve their changing needs</a>&nbsp;will set themselves up for growth.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s look at some of the ways your healthcare organization might approach the transition.</p><p><strong>Transparency and the need to deliver on trust</strong></p><p>Consumers&rsquo; trust in the healthcare system has been shaken during the pandemic. Misleading and false information, lack of consistent messaging, communications missteps and voids, cyberattacks &hellip; the confidence picture isn&rsquo;t pretty out there.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/predictions-2022-as-digitization-accelerates-lack-of-equity-labor-and-trust-plagues-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forrester predicts</a>&nbsp;this lack of trust will cause more patients to avoid treatment, which will further impact population health and the economic health of the industry.</p><p>Consumers want better ways of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-changed-the-way-us-consumers-think-about-healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addressing both physical and mental health challenges</a>. And that includes more transparency in costs and how treatments are determined, and more choice in which healthcare organizations they engage with and how that engagement happens. Consider that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.huronconsultinggroup.com/insights/healthcare-consumer-market-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60% percent</a>&nbsp;of patients say they would switch providers for greater trust and respect.</p><p>Carenet Health President&nbsp;<a href="/about/meet-the-team/">Mick Mazour</a>&nbsp;says these trends are important to keep in mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Consumers are no longer going to be content with healthcare organizations that are merely transactional in their engagement&mdash;processing claims, scheduling appointments,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They want meaningful relationships and a true anticipation of their specific personal needs. Fortunately, we&rsquo;re seeing more and&nbsp;<a href="/who-we-serve/">more health plans and health systems</a>&nbsp;taking the right steps to make that happen.&rdquo;</p>

							<p><strong>Healthcare experiences that align with how consumers manage their daily lives</strong></p><p>Personalization and convenience have never been more important. What does that look like in reality? Digital health,&nbsp;<a href="/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">telehealth</a>, remote monitoring options. Networks organized to serve patients in new ways. Better design and implementation of&nbsp;<a href="/7-strategies-to-help-health-plans-deliver-great-member-service-even-when-staffing-cant-match-demand/">24/7 service and support</a>.</p><p>Why is this so critical right now? Because healthcare consumer satisfaction ratings show there&rsquo;s a problem. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verint.com/resources/verint-experience-index-health-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verint Experience Index</a>, the average customer satisfaction score for health insurers is 79.8 out of 100. Average hospital patient satisfaction scores are comparable or lower.&nbsp;</p><p>To turn those numbers around, you&rsquo;ll need to take a proactive approach.</p>

							<p><strong>Balance your engagement frequency and relevancy to hit the mark</strong></p><p>A factor in making these visions a reality will be patient and member experience road-mapping. <a href="/about/meet-the-team/">Vikie Spulak</a>, Carenet&rsquo;s Chief Client Officer, says this is a hot topic right now. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really about determining the best ways to build trust and deliver on satisfaction without causing engagement fatigue and abrasion,&rdquo; Spulak says.</p><p><a href="/who-we-serve/healthcare-service-companies/">Healthcare service companies</a>, payers and providers that can tailor their <a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">engagement strategies</a> and service design to the new healthcare consumer&mdash;and do so with empathy and transparency&mdash;will be the ones to capitalize on the change.</p>

							<p>SAN ANTONIO, Texas, November 8, 2021 &mdash; <a href="/what-we-do/">Carenet Health</a>, one of the nation&rsquo;s largest providers of healthcare engagement solutions, has released its fourth annual<em>&nbsp;Healthcare Consumer Engagement Forecast</em>. The publication includes cross-industry insights and seven predictions for healthcare engagement in 2022, focusing on areas such as digital health, behavioral health, customer service and support, and in-home care.</p><p>One big takeaway is that a new healthcare consumer is emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic&mdash;one whose trust in the healthcare system has been shaken and whose expectations of service and convenience have changed. Healthcare organizations, from <a href="/who-we-serve/health-plans/">health plans</a> to <a href="/who-we-serve/provider-solutions/">health systems</a> to their <a href="/who-we-serve/healthcare-service-companies/">service partners</a>, are responding.</p><p><a href="/about/meet-the-team/">Carenet CEO John Erwin</a> said the pandemic has shifted the mindset of the industry when it comes to connecting with consumers, and that&rsquo;s reshaping the trajectory of healthcare engagement.</p><p>&ldquo;For the first time, we&rsquo;re seeing our clients reconsider their entire service infrastructures&mdash;not just how they&rsquo;re organized, but how they&rsquo;re staffed, how technology and facility resources are being used, and how it all relates to performance in outreach, quality of care, follow-up, coordination and loyalty,&rdquo; Erwin said.</p><p><a href="/about/meet-the-team/">Steve Harstad, Chief Strategy Officer</a> for Carenet, added that it&rsquo;s been apparent for some time that health plan members and patients want to experience healthcare like they experience retail, hospitality and other similar industries they interact with every day.</p><p>&ldquo;Pre-pandemic, healthcare as a whole has been slow to react. Now consumers are newly empowered. The tide is turning and there&rsquo;s urgency where there hasn&rsquo;t been in the past,&rdquo; Harstad said.</p><p>Supporting 250+ health organizations and engaging with 70,000 patients and health plan members every day, Carenet Health created the <em>Healthcare Consumer Engagement Forecast</em> to help healthcare organizations stay informed about and act on emerging trends.</p><p>This year&rsquo;s<em> 2022 Healthcare Consumer Engagement Forecast</em> includes these predictions:</p><ol><li>Consumer experience, satisfaction and trust will be top-priority targets for improvement.</li><li>Continued workforce challenges will drive an unprecedented restructuring of healthcare service and support.</li><li>Digital solutions will shine&mdash;if they&rsquo;re implemented thoughtfully.</li><li>Telehealth will find its best-fit place in the care ecosystem.</li><li>Access to behavioral healthcare services will accelerate, thanks to momentum in the digital space.</li><li>Payer-provider collaboration will ramp up.</li><li>In-home care will grow (and help address the deferred care crisis, too).</li></ol><p><strong>To download a complete copy of the <em>2022 Healthcare Consumer Engagement Forecast,</em> </strong><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/e8bd5c5d-d1fb-4258-93e5-14916b7aeacc.pdf"><strong>click here</strong></a>.

							<p>Carenet Health HEDIS<sup>&reg;&nbsp;</sup>engagement teams have been helping health plans and providers connect with patients about closing their gaps in care for more than 15 years. We&rsquo;re written <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="/hedis-best-practice-guide/">best-practice guides</a> about the topic, and covered the &ldquo;how&rdquo; and &ldquo;why&rdquo; of HEDIS (and <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="/stars-improvement-for-medicare-advantage-plans-new-resource-hub-launched/">CMS Stars</a>) engagement tactics on the <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="/tag/hedis-improvement/">Carenet Resource Center</a>.</p><p>Yet even with our industry-leading <a href="/">HEDIS engagement activation rates</a>, we know that asking individuals to close their gaps in care and having them accept the offer to make an appointment isn&rsquo;t easy. Even before COVID-19, four out of every five Medicare plan members across the U.S. failed to make and keep an <a href="https://www.chartspan.com/news/medicares-annual-wellness-visit-program-is-on-life-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual wellness visit</a> appointment, and studies have now revealed a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-09/covid-pandemic-missed-doctors-appointments-create-new-crisis-experts-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shadow health crisis</a> of delayed care, thanks to the pandemic. (For more information on the state of HEDIS measures, visit the <a href="https://www.ncqa.org/hedis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NCQA website</a>.)</p><p>These concerns led us to once again explore our <a href="/support-for-your-hedis-and-star-ratings-improvement-efforts/">HEDIS strategies</a>&mdash;to dig even deeper into our organizational knowledge, which is gained by working with 250+ healthcare organizations and implementing hundreds of HEDIS outreach programs at any given time.</p><p>Below, we&rsquo;ve outlined what we found to be the most common reasons health plan members and patients might decline our first offer to schedule a gap-closing appointment&mdash;and what helps move the conversation beyond that first negative reaction to a positive one.</p><p><strong>First, let&rsquo;s talk definitions and process</strong></p><p>With each live phone interaction made on behalf of our clients, our HEDIS engagement teams work through what we call the rebuttal process. A rebuttal by definition is a contradiction to a previous objection. Our multi-step process begins when an individual expresses reservation about making a medical appointment that would close a care gap. That statement should always be followed by the question: &ldquo;May I ask why you&rsquo;re not interested in scheduling your appointment with me today?&rdquo; Asking why is needed, so an engagement specialist can determine the root cause of the individual&rsquo;s hesitation or outright refusal.</p><p>Once a cause is uncovered, engagement teams can select the pre-defined rebuttal script that turns hesitancy into acceptance. Each rebuttal script should provide specific information designed to eliminate concerns and make the individual feel more comfortable with a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; decision.</p><p><strong>Now, let&rsquo;s discuss what we&rsquo;ve found to be the top reasons patients and health plan members say &ldquo;no thanks&rdquo; to appointment-setting, and the next steps we suggest for changing that response to a &ldquo;yes please.&rdquo;</strong></p><p><img class="wp-image-15731 alignnone size-thumbnail" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1-150x150-1.png" alt="" width="150" height="150"></p><p><span style="color: #E87722;">Reason for refusal:</span></p><p><strong>The individual sees an unfamiliar phone number for the incoming call and worries it&rsquo;s a scam.</strong></p><p><span style="color: #E87722;">Root cause:</span></p><p><strong>Mistrust</strong></p><p><span style="color: #E87722;">Next steps:</span></p><ul><li>Reassure the patient that you&rsquo;re calling on behalf of a known health plan or provider, using the organization&rsquo;s full and formal name.</li><li>If three-way calling is part of the program, review with the individual how you can use a conference call to schedule the appointment, with a physician practice providing additional confirmation that the outreach is legitimate.</li></ul><p><img class="wp-image-15731 alignnone size-thumbnail" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2-150x150-1.png" alt="" width="150" height="150"></p><p><span style="color: #E87722;">Reason for refusal:</span></p><p><strong>The individual says they don&rsquo;t have time to schedule an appointment right now.</strong></p><p><span style="color: #E87722;">Root cause:</span></p><p><strong>Timing of call</strong></p><p><span style="color: #E87722;">Next steps:</span></p><ul><li>Explain the call will only take a few minutes and express how much you value their time.</li><li>Discuss importance of scheduling the necessary appointments.</li><li>Mention the convenience of getting this handled right now while on the phone, which will save them additional time later in having to look up phone numbers, etc.</li><li>Ask if there is a reason why it&rsquo;s not a good time (vacation, illness, work), acknowledge the concern, reiterate you will be very quick in making this important appointment.</li><li>Praise or empathize with their final decision.</li></ul><p><img class="wp-image-15731 alignnone size-thumbnail" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/3-150x150-1.png" alt="" width="150" height="150"><br><span style="color: #E87722;">Reason for refusal:</span></p><p><strong>The individual states they will schedule the appointment on their own.</strong></p><p><span style="color: #E87722;">Root cause:</span></p><p><strong>Control</strong></p><p><span style="color: #E87722;">Next steps:</span></p><ul><li>Express the convenience of setting the appointment now and let them know they have complete input into the details.

If so, offer to call and add this screening to that appointment, if possible.</li></ul><p><img class="wp-image-15731 alignnone size-thumbnail" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/5-150x150-1.png" alt="" width="150" height="150"></p><p><span style="color: #E87722;">Reason for refusal:</span></p><p><strong>The individual says they don&rsquo;t want to discuss over the phone.</strong></p><p><span style="color: #E87722;">Root cause:</span></p><p><strong>Need for privacy</strong></p><p><span style="color: #E87722;">Next steps:</span></p><ul><li>Express understanding and offer to schedule the appointment without speaking about anything personal.</li><li>Explain you can get the physician office on the line, and they can speak directly to them.</li><li>Reiterate the convenience of getting this taken care of right now.</li></ul><p><img class="wp-image-15731 alignnone size-thumbnail" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/6-150x150-1.png" alt="" width="150" height="150"></p><p><span style="color: #E87722;">Reason for refusal:</span></p><p><strong>The individual states they do not have a primary care physician (PCP) or are changing PCPs.</strong></p><p><span style="color: #E87722;">Root cause:</span></p><p><strong>Lacks strong connection to the healthcare ecosystem</strong></p><p><span style="color: #E87722;">Next steps:</span></p><ul><li>Offer to use a provider lookup tool to find an affiliated, conveniently located physician and/or facility.</li><li>Discuss the convenience of right-now appointment setting.</li><li>Explain that scheduling an appointment will take less than 3 minutes to find a PCP close to work or home with convenient hours, and then set everything up quickly.

Believe it or not, most HEDIS engagement programs that our clients come to us for help with have no scripted rebuttals.

In our experience, robust scripts are typically not as successful as those that are more succinct.</li><li>Gauge interest with understanding and empathy.</li><li>Empower<span style="font-size: 22px;">&mdash;</span>don&rsquo;t pressure<span style="font-size: 22px;">&mdash;</span>individuals to make their own decisions.</li><li>Use the individual&rsquo;s name in your conversation.

							<p>Telehealth&mdash;and telehealth nurses&mdash;aren&rsquo;t new. Nurses have been guiding and caring for patients via <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/aca30edd-c249-4a6c-ae3e-838479775eba.pdf">nurse advice lines</a> and nurse-provided phone triage for years. But as telehealth utilization in all its current forms has grown exponentially (and now stabilized), it&rsquo;s time to revisit the role of a registered nurse.</p><p>The COVID-19 crisis has proven that telehealth can improve access to care. But the volume of telehealth visits has also at times threatened to overwhelm healthcare organizations, from clinical practices to managed care health plans. Most on-demand telehealth services are &ldquo;quarterbacked&rdquo; by physicians. A patient clicks to connect, answers a few text-based questions, then joins the queue for an MD e-consult. As telehealth becomes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shamahyder/2020/11/16/where-telehealth-is-headed-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even more popular</a>, that model is <a href="/for-sustainable-telehealth-growth-we-need-to-talk-smarter-resource-management/">neither the most efficient nor sustainable.</a></p><p>This is where nurses can play a crucial role.</p><p><span style="color: #e23b56;"><strong>Efficient care at a lower cost</strong></span></p><p>By leveraging experienced telehealth registered nurses (RNs) prior to a virtual physician e-consult, organizations can ensure effectively triaged care and help patients seek the appropriate setting for that &nbsp;care. At Carenet Health, our data has shown that at least 40% of <a href="/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">telehealth visits</a> don&rsquo;t require physician interaction and can be treated at home with guidance from an RN. Nurse-provided patient triage can not only alleviate some of the burden on physicians who are already stretched thin, but also help patients avoid unnecessary primary care appointments or <a href="https://carenethealthcare.com/how-to-improve-your-health-plans-er-diversion-strategy">divert some emergency department and urgent care visits</a> &ndash; which significantly reduces costs.</p><p><strong>&rArr;</strong><strong> Proof in point:</strong> One large health plan implemented symptom triage delivered by RNs prior to a virtual physician consult. Of symptomatic callers with pre-intent to visit the emergency department (ED), 87% were redirected to a less emergent level of care. Only 20% of calls resulted in the RN referring the patient to the on-demand telehealth physician service. The health plan also saw $12 million in annual savings, which amounted to an average savings of $100 per interaction per member. Overall, the nurse triage line delivered a 3:1 return on investment to the health plan. (<a href="/nurse-triage-before-telehealth-visits-delivers-31-roi-and-millions-in-savings/">Full case study is available here</a>.)</p><p>In another <a href="/data-shows-value-of-telehealth-nurse-triage-and-impact-of-pandemic-on-consumer-behavior/">Carenet study</a>, we found that patients were very often wrong about the level of care they needed. Data showed 57% of patients were ultimately redirected to a different level of care than what they thought they needed at the beginning of a telehealth nurse interaction.</p><p><span style="color: #e23b56;"><strong>Improved patient experience</strong></span></p><p>Long wait times are always a drawback for patients, no matter where they&rsquo;re seeking care. While telehealth has helped reduce the inconvenience of traveling and waiting in a doctor&rsquo;s office or ED to be seen, it hasn&rsquo;t eliminated it. A study published in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7705823/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Journal of Patient Experience</em></a>, which examined the telehealth experience of patients with COVID-19 symptoms in 2020, found the average wait time for online physician visits was 75.5 minutes. Some patients experienced wait times as high as almost four hours (222.5 minutes).</p><p>As the number of patients seeking care in the future via telehealth rises and the nation&rsquo;s physician shortage also grows, the virtual patient experience could be at risk. A dedicated nurse triage team could be a path to improving the experience by engaging with patients prior to their wait for an MD&mdash;providing convenient access to high-quality 24/7 clinical care.</p><p>A single point of access to all forms of virtual care can have an impact, as well. For instance, in the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Carenet_Telehealth-Brochure.pdf">Carenet Health Virtual Clinic model</a>, patients have a streamlined front door to virtual care, similar to a traditional provider clinic. Intake coordinators efficiently handle calls, which are then triaged by telehealth-trained RNs and elevated to physician e-consults when appropriate. The result is a more seamless, convenient and stress-reducing experience for patients. Additional types of virtual care could be added to the point of entry, such as <a href="/one-stop-behavioral-health-crisis-support-delivers-95-ed-diversion/">crisis behavioral health support</a>.</p><p><strong>&rArr; </strong><strong>Proof in point:</strong> One of the nation&rsquo;s largest health plans saw a 96% patient satisfaction rating when they transitioned to an upfront nurse triage solution. At Carenet, the average score across all clients for patient satisfaction after a nurse interaction is 99%. In contrast, the overall customer satisfaction score for physician-on-demand &nbsp;services is 86%, according to the <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2020-us-telehealth-satisfaction-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest study by J.D. Power</a>.</p><p><span style="color: #e23b56;"><strong>Compassionate, high-quality care</strong></span></p><p>Having a team of experienced nurses available around the clock to assess symptoms and provide site and course of care recommendations can help fuel better patient decision-making and better outcomes. One of the keys to those goals is staffing the team with skilled and well-trained clinical professionals. At Carenet, for example, our telehealth RNs have an average of 15 years of clinical experience and 5 years of telehealth experience, and they&rsquo;re trained in empathy, influence, state/federal regulations, URAC standards and how to <a href="/achieving-healthcare-engagement-success-with-specialty-populations/">work with diverse populations.</a></p><p><strong>&rArr; </strong><strong>Proof in point:</strong> A typical physician e-consult can address fewer than 50 types of patient concerns. Triage nurses using <a href="https://www.stcc-triage.com/the-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schmitt-Thompson<sup>&reg;</sup> evidence-based guidelines</a> for telehealth are trained on 700 adult and pediatric conditions.</p><p><span style="color: #e23b56;"><strong>Telehealth is evolving&mdash;the role of nurses should, too</strong></span></p><p>As telehealth becomes more popular, the role of a skilled telehealth nurse is an asset that must be further and more strategically explored. The impact of nurse triage and support is poised to make virtual care more sustainable, cost-effective and satisfying for consumers.</p><p>Fortunately, a good first step is a fairly easy one: Consider enhancing your current MD-on-demand solution by adding a proven nurse triage service upfront. <a href="/contact/">Contact us today</a> if you&rsquo;d like more information on how that can be accomplished for your organization.</p>

						<section class="elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-67cde8e7 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default" data-id="67cde8e7" data-element_type="section">
						
					
			
						
				
							<p>The health plan member experience is high stakes in healthcare right now&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s heightened <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="/special-resource-collection-medicare-advantage-cms-stars-program/">Medicare Advantage Star rating measures</a>, ACA marketplace competition or the need to keep employers and their employees satisfied. That&rsquo;s why smart payers are taking time to rethink how they communicate with their members. In some cases, they&rsquo;re even completely reorganizing their customer support teams around the <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="/what-we-do/">delivery of outstanding experiences</a>.</p><p>A key part of that retooling involves communication channels. Consider that by next year, experts estimate that <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-cx-trends-for-cios-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70% of all customer interactions</a> in the U.S. will be via some sort of digital channel. That list of digital channels keeps growing, too: SMS/text messaging, app use and chatbots with conversational AI capabilities, among others. For the record, those channels are valuable and necessary.</p><p>But in the rush to serve changing digital health and customer service needs, we can&rsquo;t, as an industry, forget the power of a personal phone call.</p><p>Here are just a few of the reasons we&rsquo;ve been talking about lately at Carenet Health.</p><p><strong>01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First and foremost, healthcare is personal&mdash;and compassion and optimism are difficult to convey digitally. </strong>Sometimes, you just need to hear the inflection, empathy, hope and warmth in a voice-to-voice conversation. Stacie Stoner, Carenet&rsquo;s Vice President of Client Success, sees firsthand the value created in live interactions. &ldquo;We know that one-on-one phone connections between a health plan and a member make it easier to establish credibility &hellip; easier to ask insightful questions. And it&rsquo;s easier to provide answers that are <a href="/what-does-health-plan-member-advocacy-look-like-in-action/">complex and multifaceted</a>.&rdquo; (Read more insights from Stacie <a href="/gap-closing-strategies-for-medicare-plans-todays-tips-from-the-field/">here</a>.)</p><p><strong>02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A call stops the scroll.</strong> As Pamela Cone, Carenet&rsquo;s Senior Consultant, Business Solutions, says, &ldquo;Phone calls are still one of the best, most cost-effective ways for gaining and maintaining an individual&rsquo;s undivided attention.&rdquo; This is particularly significant when you&rsquo;re asking a member to take a certain action, like closing a gap in care, <a href="/proactive-medication-adherence-outreach-stops-rx-gaps-before-they-happen/">enrolling in a mail-order pharmacy program</a> or taking the next step in chronic care management.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not everyone has the tech (or tech know-how) for effective digital communications.</strong> Broadband infrastructure is advancing and should continue to improve over the next several years. But until changes occur, the number of Americans without high-speed internet is still around <a href="https://broadbandnow.com/research/fcc-underestimates-unserved-by-50-percent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 million</a>. Those impacted are disproportionately in rural, low-income and medically vulnerable groups. Other studies indicate that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/07/digital-divide-persists-even-as-lower-income-americans-make-gains-in-tech-adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30% of low-income households</a> and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2768771" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20% of Medicare beneficiaries</a> may lack a smartphone, with higher percentages among Black and Hispanic beneficiaries. We also know that when it comes to using apps and portals, technical utilization skills are an issue. That&rsquo;s why our multichannel outreach plans almost always include a live outreach component to ensure effectiveness.</p><p><strong>04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversational AI algorithms are getting better, but often still fall short.</strong> Despite growing sophistication, chatbots still have a lower rate of problem resolution than human-to-human interactions because they simply <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3947357/market-guide-for-virtual-customer-assistants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can&rsquo;t go as deep as a human</a>. Exchanging messages with an AI-based bot or SMS solution can be convenient and helpful, but it doesn&rsquo;t always make it easy to reach a member&rsquo;s or an organization&rsquo;s end goal. These solutions are highly efficient (and we often recommend them) for basic requests, but more involved dialogue situations require an authentic, human-driven connection. A health plan&rsquo;s use of phone calls also entails a lower level of tech capital and investment than, say, a natural language processing solution.</p><p><strong>05&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phone call outreach, enabling meaningful two-way conversations, can be implemented quickly</strong>. In fact, it can be as simple as giving Carenet a target list. We&rsquo;ll develop a custom contact dialing strategy, then hit &ldquo;go.&rdquo; Deployment can be fast and painless. (For more information on what happens behind the scenes to develop a successful outbound healthcare engagement contact strategy, <a href="/how-strong-is-your-contact-strategy-for-outbound-healthcare-engagement/">download our infographic</a>.)</p><p><strong>06&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You only get one chance to make a first impression.</strong> <a href="/health-plan-member-satisfaction-are-you-just-an-information-provider-or-are-you-building-trust/">Building trust</a> at the beginning of a member relationship is important. The first time a member interacts with your plan will begin to shape their satisfaction and loyalty right away. We encourage health plans to be cognizant of how they want to orchestrate first-time communications and those early consumer communications needs. For instance, are <a href="/welcome-calls-and-hedis-gap-closure-medicare-advantage/">welcome communications</a> the right time to risk a digital interaction with a new member or is a phone call the more engaging way to start? The answer may be either depending on your goals, but this is something that needs to be strategically considered as a part of the health plan member experience.</p><p><strong>07&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Digital can mean patient privacy concerns.</strong> Protecting patient privacy is paramount, and there are a lot of moving parts when it comes to personal and sensitive healthcare data. Consumers can <a href="https://healthitsecurity.com/news/25-of-patients-did-not-access-data-over-patient-privacy-concerns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have their own concerns</a>, third-party apps&rsquo; privacy policies aren&rsquo;t always straightforward and healthcare organizations (or their partners) must continually invest in best-in-class technology and processes to ensure data safety. As D.J. Toms, Carenet&rsquo;s VP of Information Technology, says: &ldquo;Phone calls remain secure and are proven to be a bridge from privacy worries to consumer assurance.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>08&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phone calls are successful, regardless of target audience.</strong> Chatbots, email and text can be appropriate for some audiences and for some health-related interactions, but not all. But live phone interactions? They work for all populations and a variety of member support needs. Lisa Policano, Director of Business Solutions at Carenet, put it this way: &ldquo;There are just times when a personal touch from a live person is needed, regardless of the market segment &hellip; Medicare, Medicaid, Marketplace or Commercial. So keep in mind that the type of interaction should really drive the choice of channel.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;09&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The argument that &ldquo;no one answers the phone anymore&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t stand up to the data. </strong>A typical successful yield at Carenet from a live phone outreach campaign can range from 30% to 50%, with some hitting even higher thresholds. That success rate depends on a lot of factors, such as the reason for the call, quality of the list, number of call attempts and calling windows. &ldquo;There are a lot of variables,&rdquo; says Dave Dreggors, VP of Business Development at Carenet. &ldquo;The key is to leverage advanced technology and contact management strategies, along with team managers that have years of experience in healthcare. With a dedicated team of professionals, we can efficiently provide a one-on-one, premier experience on a large scale.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Convenience doesn&rsquo;t always mean digital.</strong> Consumers today expect to be able to engage with your health plan at any time, across multiple devices and channels. But preferred convenience in many industries, including healthcare, can mean speaking to a person first. Plus, <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-157/Accenture-The-Future-Customer-Conversations.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent study</a> found that one-third of all consumers, of all ages, who started in chat, regardless of whether virtual or live agents, still needed to go elsewhere to get the help they required.</p><p><strong>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three-way calling for appointment scheduling is easiest starting with a live outreach call.&nbsp;</strong>There&rsquo;s something about a call, with actual human voices, shared among a member, their plan and their provider&rsquo;s office that helps individuals agree to <a href="/support-for-your-hedis-and-star-ratings-improvement-efforts/">close their gaps in care</a>.</p><p><span style="color: #e23b56;"><strong>The health plan member experience: Wrapping it all up</strong></span></p><p>Member satisfaction and the consumer experience should always be a driving influence in strategic communications planning. Digital channels and tactics will absolutely continue to be vital as healthcare evolves. But keep in mind that technology should be implemented in context and that great conversations with your members build brand capital and rapport and create value. An outstanding healthcare experience still requires voice-to-voice touchpoints. And there are many ways to make digital and live phone interactions work well together, so you can reach your goals.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to discuss your member experience touchpoints, <a href="/contact/">please reach out to us today</a>.</p>

							<h5>Carenet Health pulls back the curtain on what it takes to design a successful contact strategy&mdash;so you can see how your tactics compare.</h5><p>Targeted outreach by phone remains a critical part of any healthcare organization&rsquo;s toolbox. And a robust healthcare engagement contact strategy should always be at work behind the scenes to increase not only the chance of connection, but also the odds of connecting with each patient or health plan member at the right time to ensure a successful conversation.</p><p>In this illustrative infographic, we offer an inside look at the anatomy of a strong contact strategy&mdash;from contact validation to interaction schedules and much more.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>What can prompt and motivate hesitant <a href="/who-we-serve/health-plans/medicare/">Medicare plan members</a> to seek out and show up for their preventive and chronic care appointments? That&rsquo;s the riddle everyone in the industry continues to try to solve, for the good of patients, <a href="https://www.ncqa.org/hedis/measures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HEDIS</a><sup>&reg;&nbsp;</sup>and <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Prescription-Drug-Coverage/PrescriptionDrugCovGenIn/PerformanceData" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stars quality measures</a>, and everyone&rsquo;s bottom line.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/staciestoner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stacie Stoner</a>, Carenet Health&rsquo;s VP of Client Success, the answer is continuously evolving&mdash;but almost always lies at the intersection of reliable best practices, minor tweaks to those proven strategies, and new ideas for closing gaps in care.</p><p>To give us a quick view of what&rsquo;s getting results in today&rsquo;s healthcare landscape, we asked Stacie to share a few insights from Carenet&rsquo;s gap-closing engagement work, which supports <a href="/tag/hedis-improvement/">HEDIS and Medicare Advantage Stars initiatives</a> for more than 100 health plans. (For a complete review of strategies that are working to close more gaps in care, <a href="/whats-new-in-closing-gaps-in-care-and-what-still-works/">download our brief.)</a></p><p><strong>Q: Reluctance to schedule care has always been an issue, but we know there are tried-and-true tactics that can and do work. Which of those would you say are still working exponentially well right now? </strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> At Carenet, we&rsquo;ve been helping Medicare plans close gaps in care for more than 15 years, and we know for certain that one of the most pressing reasons members don&rsquo;t act is a lack of understanding of what&rsquo;s really needed, when and why. <em>(Editor&rsquo;s note: Studies show </em><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthliteracy/shareinteract/TellOthers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>nearly 9 out of 10 adults struggle with understanding routine health information</em></a><em>.)</em></p><p>Calm and knowledgeable, voice-to-voice conversation still works better than anything else for the Medicare population, to explain unfamiliar terms and provide reassurance. Once that connection is made, <a href="/category/content-type/case-study/">our data</a> shows that 70% or more of contacted members will agree to schedule an appointment. The key is ensuring the person representing the plan can <a href="/health-plan-member-satisfaction-are-you-just-an-information-provider-or-are-you-building-trust/">establish trust</a>, and educate and encourage members with empathy and age sensitivity. That level of skill can only be accomplished through rigorous team hiring, training and coaching.</p><p><strong>Q: People aren&rsquo;t answering their phones as much these days, though. Doesn&rsquo;t that have an impact?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> It absolutely does. Making that connection in the first place, getting a member to answer the phone call, isn&rsquo;t getting any easier&mdash;although sophisticated data appends, <a href="/about/technology/">advanced CRM technology</a> and predictive dialing strategies can all increase contact success by a substantial amount. We&rsquo;re also finding that by combining text messaging prior to attempting phone calls, we can essentially &ldquo;prime&rdquo; a member to interact. Familiarity is established and the member begins to anticipate a conversation. Specifically, our data shows that two or three preliminary texts can deliver excellent results. Our clients are happy, and their members feel valued and cared about.</p><p><strong>Q: Are there new ways plans can anticipate and prevent gaps in care before they occur?</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: Data and analytics, and now <a href="https://patientengagementhit.com/news/how-is-artificial-intelligence-shaping-patient-engagement-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI</a>, certainly have a role to play there. But one high-touch strategy we&rsquo;re seeing more plans leverage is <a href="/what-we-do/advocacy-solutions/">member advocacy programs</a>.</p><p>The use of advocates can establish a personal point-of-access for members, not only to help them understand everything from prevention to disease management needs, but also to easily link them to necessary care and information. Medicare members appreciate that their personal advocates make healthcare navigation less frustrating and confusing. We&rsquo;ve seen that proactive advocacy effectively demystifies healthcare steps and keeps the member engaged.</p><p><strong>Q: Is there a common mistake you&rsquo;ve seen plans making in their approach to HEDIS improvement today</strong><strong>?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Medicare plans that approach HEDIS as a short-term, one-channel, seasonal project&mdash;as opposed to an ongoing, multi-channel initiative&mdash;tend to have a harder time hitting performance goals. Year-long strategic engagement helps the member-plan relationship grow over time, and gaps can be addressed sooner.</p><p><strong>Q: What final advice can you share for closing gaps in care?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> To stay in step with <a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-influencing-consumer-healthcare-behavior-and-some-changes-may" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumer expectations and behaviors</a>, evaluate your gap-closing strategies at regular intervals, and be ready to update them. Keep an open mind, and be willing to test new ideas. Continuous optimization of member engagement, before, during and after an outreach effort, is important.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Discover much more about what&rsquo;s working to close gaps in care in our brief, <a href="/whats-new-in-closing-gaps-in-care-and-what-still-works/"><em>New + Tried and True: Five Ways to Close More Gaps in Care</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Rather have a conversation about your needs right now? <a href="/contact/">Contact us</a> for an in-depth discussion with our Medicare engagement experts.</p><p><span style="font-size: small;">HEDIS<sup>&reg;</sup> is a registered trademark of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA).</span></p>

							<p>Organizational resilience is a hot topic in health plan C-suites and boardrooms right now. A growing concern in those conversations is workforce strategies&mdash;a root factor of resilience.</p><p>After all, the global workforce is undergoing <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/the-future-of-work-after-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significant change</a>. It&rsquo;s a trend that includes remote teams, <a href="https://hive.com/blog/what-is-hybrid-team/">hybrid teams</a>, the gig economy, and a period of intense <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decision-making and transition</a> (i.e., how to return to office, who returns, and where).</p><p><a href="/about/meet-the-team/">John Erwin</a>, Carenet Health CEO, says forward-thinking health plans are reassessing the nature of work amidst mounting challenges. Those challenges range from productivity concerns like absenteeism and remote team management to escalating hiring issues and higher staff turnover, especially as contact center positions compete for service jobs in a re-opening economy.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having conversations every week with leaders who are beginning to contemplate a shift in workforce architectures,&rdquo; John said.</p><p>&ldquo;Health plans are not only dealing with the pandemic-related workforce disruptions that all industries are facing, but they&rsquo;re also focused on <a href="/special-resource-collection-medicare-advantage-cms-stars-program/">recent quality measure changes</a> and greater demand for better, around-the-clock member services and engagement. It&rsquo;s giving leaders an opportunity to reconsider <a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">member experience strategies</a>&mdash;and whether or not their strategies are flexible and scalable enough to respond.&rdquo;</p><p>A few of the questions being asked include:</p><ul><li>How can we optimize workforce strategies to improve member satisfaction and the consumer experience?</li><li>What is the role of the member engagement workforce in changing quality measures and revenue optimization?</li><li>Are large, internally managed contact centers sustainable? Does it make sense to have, for example, only 50% of seats filled in a large-volume facility (and 50% of staff working remotely)?</li><li>Is there new value in adjusting the percentages of engagement outsourcing, insourcing and co-sourcing?</li><li>How can we work better with healthcare service partners to deliver long-term engagement performance improvements?</li><li>What new technology is needed for today&rsquo;s engagement? Do we want to invest in that spend? How will we continue to keep up with future tech changes and demands?</li></ul><p><a href="/about/meet-the-team/">Mick Mazour</a>, Carenet Health president, agrees there is rising uncertainty when it comes to how engagement teams will be designed and managed moving forward.</p><p>&ldquo;Carenet is both a healthcare engagement and contact center workforce specialist. So in many ways, we&rsquo;re tackling the same challenges on a larger scale,&rdquo; Mick said. &ldquo;The good news is we&rsquo;re already implementing strategies and optimizing them in real time.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>&gt; &gt;Continue the discussion.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Is your healthcare organization reassessing workforce strategies in the face of labor shortages, high turnover, new workforce models and a heightened need for outstanding consumer engagement?</p><p><a href="/">Our team</a> is happy to brainstorm ideas and share what we&rsquo;ve learned&mdash;and continue to learn&mdash;from our work with <a href="/who-we-serve/">250+ of the nation&rsquo;s premier healthcare organizations</a>, including 100+ health plans.</p><p><a href="/contact/">Contact us to start the conversation</a>.</p>

							<p>In today&rsquo;s marketplace that is intently focused on member satisfaction, health plans&mdash;particularly Medicare Advantage plans concerned about Stars ratings&mdash;may want to ask themselves: &ldquo;Am I really building trust with my member engagement strategies? Or am I just pushing information out to members?&rdquo;</p><p>While the two go hand in hand to help health plans establish member relationships, trust requires patient-centered, multichannel, <a href="/healthcare-engagement-trend-siloed-efforts/">connected communications</a>. Members expect health plans to know them, whether they interact via telehealth, phone, the plan&rsquo;s portal or text. And in the pandemic era, <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2021/01/27/trust-is-the-new-consumer-currency-in-the-pandemic-era/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trust is now the currency</a> for any business, especially healthcare.</p><p><strong>Filling the consumer confidence gap </strong></p><p>The <a href="https://www.edelman.com/trust/2021-trust-barometer">2021 Edelman Trust Barometer</a> reports that consumer trust in most information sources is already low. Faith in government eroded during the pandemic, leaving businesses to fill the trust gap. Nearly 90% of the survey&rsquo;s respondents agreed that CEOs must lead on important issues. <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2020-us-commercial-member-health-plan-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Other studies</a> have also shed specific light on the need for healthcare organizations to show consumers they care by connecting in ways that matter.</p><p><strong>Embracing frequency and much more</strong></p><p>How <a href="/who-we-serve/health-plans/">health plans</a> engage with members has come a long way in recent years. The thinking used to be: the fewer times a plan interacted with members, the lower the costs. Now health plans know that improved outcomes, cost-savings and member satisfaction can be a direct result of involvement with members&rsquo; care, every step of the way.</p><p>Yet frequent engagement doesn&rsquo;t automatically equal a relationship built on trust. For that to happen, members need to feel their health plan &ldquo;gets them.&rdquo; <a href="/about/intelligent-engagement/">Data-driven engagement</a> can help inform member conversations, personalize virtual interactions and demonstrate you truly know your members.&nbsp;Plans should consider how their communications make members feel, starting <a href="/7-key-steps-for-successfully-onboarding-and-cultivating-member-relationships/">from the beginning</a> of plan enrollment, and then commit to regularly <a href="/eight-ways-to-optimize-patient-engagement-to-address-social-determinants-of-health/">removing any bottlenecks</a> in the member&rsquo;s ability to get care along the way.</p><p>A few questions can help you drive planning discussions:</p><ul><li>Can members access information quickly and easily to make different types of healthcare decisions? Do you have survey data to prove it?</li><li>Can members receive personalized support for specific care situations?&nbsp;How easy is it to get that support?</li><li>Do you have data or <a href="/three-steps-to-improved-member-experience-and-loyalty-for-health-plans/">an index</a> that shows the level of compassion members experience when interacting with the plan?</li></ul><p><strong>Three factors to help you meet health plan member expectations </strong></p><p>So much of success in building trust will be rooted in consumer expectations. According to <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/us/articles/6963_global-marketing-trends/DI_2021-Global-Marketing-Trends_US.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deloitte&rsquo;s 2021 Global Marketing Trends</a>, &ldquo;when delivery doesn&rsquo;t meet expectations, trust breaks down.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p>Your health plan&rsquo;s reputation and member satisfaction levels are ultimately determined by how well the member experience you deliver aligns with the promises you make.</p></blockquote><p>Your members&rsquo; expectations may vary, but we know &mdash;based on our work with 70,000 healthcare consumer interactions every day&mdash;that three key factors are rarely absent from the list. Those are reliability, transparency and empathy.</p><ul><li><strong>Reliability</strong></li></ul><p style="padding-left: 80px;">When members need care or have questions, and especially when they&rsquo;re experiencing a crisis or complex diagnosis, the most trusted health plans are available, offering information, stability and reassurance. Use of integrated data at all touchpoints is important here, as is making sure service teams know the right questions to ask &hellip; and don&rsquo;t ask ones the plan should already have the answers to.</p><ul><li><strong>Transparency</strong></li></ul><p style="padding-left: 80px;">Being clear and open about your processes, coverages and costs is also critical. And make communication a two-way street&mdash;give your members the opportunity to share opinions and ask for their input on how to improve the overall experience with the plan and your provider networks.</p><ul><li><strong>Empathy</strong></li></ul><p style="padding-left: 80px;">Lower member satisfaction levels are often linked to lack of care coordination and empathy, not coverage issues. An empathy-driven service team and organizational culture starts with formal training and coaching that institutionalizes compassion and caring. This will help ensure your teams demonstrate dedication to member well-being, especially when it has no direct benefit for the plan.</p><p><strong>Wrapping up</strong></p><p>Nurturing member relationships by building trust into every touchpoint can only make your members appreciate your plan more. And the bottom line is that without a well-established, trusted relationship, members won&rsquo;t turn to their insurance plan very often. And that means plans won&rsquo;t have a place at the table to help guide and address decisions, care, satisfaction and costs.</p><p>For more ideas to improve your plan&rsquo;s member experience, request a copy of our ebook, <a href="/8-ways-health-plans-can-transform-member-relationships-in-a-covid-19-world/"><em>The COVID-19 Pandemic as a Wake-up Call: How Health Plans Can Seize the Moment to&nbsp;</em><em>Transform Member Relationships</em>.</a></p><p>We&rsquo;re always here to answer any healthcare engagement questions you have.

							<p>Patients are ultimately consumers of health-related information and care. And in today&rsquo;s world of <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="/covid-19-is-changing-healthcare-consumer-behavior-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">growing expectations,</a> they want easier and quicker access to that care and information&mdash;on their terms.</p><p>That means they want a resolution of their questions or needs the first time they interact with your organization. And they want to be able to access what they need <a href="/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">on-demand</a>&mdash;whether that&rsquo;s 5:30 p.m. on a Wednesday or 1 a.m. on a Sunday night.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s also why <a href="/who-we-serve/provider-solutions/">providers</a> and other types of <a href="/who-we-serve/">healthcare organizations</a> are having to rethink not only their service availability but also how patients navigate through initial contact with clinics and the resulting patient experience.</p><p>At <a href="/about/">Carenet Health</a>, we often talk with our clients about a unified and optimized patient service center approach. Here are a few of the factors we urge them to consider:</p><p><strong>What is a premier patient experience?</strong></p><p>Walk through a typical patient&rsquo;s interaction with your organization. Pinpoint what happens at each connection and what the possible outcomes for the patient might be. For example, will they be directed to a different phone number or access point after initial contact? Does someone&mdash;a nurse or physician or referral department, perhaps&mdash;often have to call patients back? Then, point-by-point, consider how all of those interactions could be made easier for the best possible patient experience. What would the perfect scenario look like? <a href="/innovative-patient-experience-carenet/">Check out this case study</a> for some ideas.</p><p><strong>What are the top-priority objectives for your different types of staff members?</strong></p><p>For physicians, that might be to improve the health of all patients. For <a href="https://www.aap.org/en-us/professional-resources/practice-transformation/managing-practice/Pages/Front-Desk-Roles-Responsibilities.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">front-desk staff,</a> it might be to ensure the office runs smoothly in a way that benefits patients and clinical staff. Be precise; vocational nurses might have different goals than registered nurses on the team. Then consider which tasks those team members are doing every day that don&rsquo;t help them achieve their priority objectives. Those may be <a href="/healthcare-appointment-scheduling-what-to-look-for-when-you-outsource/">responsibilities you can outsource</a> and/or move to a centralized patient service center.</p>

							<p><strong>What types of services would a concierge-level experience address?</strong></p><p>Brainstorm the ways you could add value to your patients. How can you make their healthcare system interactions more helpful and convenient, and reduce patient effort? What areas do your typical patients need help with? Transportation scheduling? Care navigation and coordination? Medical records requests? Care obstacles? This list could help you frame a new kind of service approach.</p><blockquote><p><a href="/what-types-of-questions-can-a-health-advocate-or-health-plan-concierge-answer/"><strong><em>&gt; Editor&rsquo;s note: For some tips on what types of requests concierge-level services might tackle, check out this blog post.</em></strong></a></p></blockquote><p><strong>How can you approach patient engagement, virtual care and navigation as a consolidated approach?</strong></p><p>We often find that our clients think of these concepts as separate entities. Yet they exist in the same ecosystem and are closely related in terms of patient value and access&mdash;and even have similar best practices. We encourage our clients to think about how the strategies that work in one area (like virtual care) can be adapted for patient engagement, and so on. This&nbsp;<a href="/a-turning-point-in-the-complex-intersection-of-consumer-needs-changing-care-access-and-advocacy/">trend brief</a>&nbsp;offers some ideas.</p><p><strong>How can you better leverage your patient data?</strong></p><p>Personalization, driven by patient data, is the path forward for&nbsp;<a href="https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.17.0559" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patient-centered care</a>. But is that data available at all patient access points? Can the electronic health record (EHR) be better integrated for streamlined and more relevant patient interactions?</p><p><strong>Seeing additional benefits materialize</strong></p><p>Answering the above questions can help our clients understand the potential pitfalls of their current patient access and navigation journey and see the benefits of a streamlined and optimized-for-the-patient model.</p><p>Some of the benefits they may not have thought about earlier often emerge during the process, such as:</p><ul><li>Minimizing burnout and reducing workday clinical interruptions</li><li>Removing the burden of managing an internal contact center, on-call scheduling and multiple vendors</li><li>Impacting quality measures, plus consumer reviews and ratings&mdash;which equal revenue</li><li>Offering the ability to grow, innovate and scale as needs evolve</li><li>Ensuring an&nbsp;<a href="/optimized-member-engagement-one-plans-journey-to-fewer-silos-and-better-results/">enterprise-wide strategy</a>&nbsp;that drives efficiencies and best-practice consistency across every clinic and patient touchpoint</li><li>Reducing clinical liability, such as that which can occur when staff members answer questions or give guidance that is above their license</li><li>Providing the most convenient and efficient patient experience</li><li>Increasing patient satisfaction and loyalty in new ways</li></ul><p><strong>Want to learn more?</strong></p><p>At Carenet Health, our streamlined, 24/7 care and information access model is transforming the patient experience using resource tiers and seamless navigation.&nbsp;<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/06e98724-dfe5-4d75-86a5-9b0d8a9d42ce.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download our information sheet for details.</a>&nbsp;Or&nbsp;<a href="/contact/">contact us</a>&nbsp;today for a conversation.</p><p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p><p>More thought leadership content is always available on our easily searchable industry&nbsp;<a href="/resource-center/">Resource Center</a>.</p>

							<p><a href="https://www.risenational.com/">RISE National</a> is one of the industry&rsquo;s most notable gatherings for discussions of risk adjustment and quality improvement&mdash;especially as they relate to accountable care and government-payer reform topics.</p><p><a href="/">Carenet Health</a>&nbsp;was proud to be a Silver Sponsor of this year&rsquo;s conference, held virtually on March 26, 29 and 30, 2021. From&nbsp;<a href="https://www.risenational.com/2021-agenda/">thought-provoking keynotes to inspiring breakouts</a>, the event provided a broad look at the challenges Medicare Advantage (MA), ACA and other health plans and related organizations are facing. Continued&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom">regulatory changes</a>&nbsp;from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) were top of mind. Areas such as patient experience, member engagement and mental healthcare access were hot topics. (You can read one case study on improving behavioral health access&nbsp;<a href="/one-stop-behavioral-health-crisis-support-delivers-95-ed-diversion/">here</a>.)</p><p>To continue the conversation, we recently caught up with several of our Carenet experts who attended&nbsp;<a href="https://www.risenational.com/brochure">RISE National 2021</a>&nbsp;to get their key takeaways and a few insights on where we go from here.</p><p><strong>Shifting patient experience measure weights in the CMS Stars program</strong></p>

							<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyndiklement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyndi Klement</a>, Carenet&rsquo;s newest VP&ndash;Business Development, said there seemed to be a visceral feeling of concern from MA plans over the four-time increased weight placed on member experience measures coming soon in the&nbsp;<a href="/infographic-2021-23-stars-changes-and-impact-analysis/">CMS Stars program</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;Not surprisingly, everyone is feeling the pressure of this year&rsquo;s countdown. They acknowledge it&rsquo;s a big change that demands adjusted resource allocation, doing the right things early in the game and achieving organizational alignment around experience management. They want a plan for getting ahead of CAHPS surveying, and they have less than a year to make an impact.&rdquo;</p><p><em>&mdash; Cyndi Klement, Carenet Health VP&ndash;Business Development</em></p>

							<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markureste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Ureste</a>, VP&ndash;Business Development, said it was clear there was hesitation from MA plans on what the next steps should be when it comes to&nbsp;<a href="/these-ideas-for-improving-stars-member-experience-scores-may-not-be-on-your-radar-yet-but-they-should-be/">new strategies for patient experience</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;The fact is, there are no textbook strategies yet; plans just know they should be thinking beyond traditional member engagement right now. They are going to need the ability to try some things, take action, fail fast&mdash;and not let the desire for perfection get in the way of some substantial impact.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&nbsp;<em>Mark Ureste, Carenet Health VP&ndash;Business Development</em></p>

							<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanphillip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bryan Phillip</a>, Business Development Manager at Carenet, added that improving provider-payer connections and coordination is also playing into the&nbsp;<a href="/the-2021-cms-star-ratings-are-here-what-do-they-mean-for-your-member-engagement-strategies/">Stars strategy discussions</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a known disconnect right now that can lead to negative patient satisfaction scores if not addressed. Patients want and need their care providers and health plans on the same page and working in concert. There was a lot of talk about how to improve that communication. Value-based care models are also making that provider-payer-patient connection more important.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&nbsp;<em>Bryan Phillip, Business Development Manager</em></p>

							<p><strong>Finding ways to identify and tackle members&rsquo; social determinants of health</strong></p><p>How to successfully address social determinants of health (SDOH) also dominated a lot of dialogue at RISE, according to both Cyndi and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-dreggors-214a7411/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Dreggors</a>, VP&ndash;Business Development at Carenet</p><p>&ldquo;Internet access and the digital divide are on plan leaders&rsquo; minds, along with food insecurity and housing uncertainty &hellip; even air quality &hellip; heating and cooling. How do plans and providers solve for those, especially in difficult-to-reach, high-risk populations? How can member engagement&mdash;both live interactions and digital&mdash;be used to get members connected to the right services? It was good to hear that many plans are really open to testing different tactics to find one that works for&nbsp; their population.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&nbsp;<em>David Dreggors,&nbsp;</em><em>VP&ndash;Business Development</em></p>

							&ldquo;One-on-one, real-time, data- and pattern-driven outreach; in-home evaluations and at-home care; better predictive modeling and consumer engagement profiling; improved collaboration and care navigation that closes the loop on what might be needed and what is actually addressed; holistic clinical, social and behavioral health approaches &hellip; these are all promising ways to tackle social determinants that are currently on the table.&rdquo;

							<p><strong>Pivoting to work with new kinds of data and drivers</strong></p><p>Another underlying theme: Plans are finding themselves working within new and unfamiliar datasets and are understandably unsure of how to act on the data to make a difference.</p>						
				
				
				
					
							&ldquo;Traditionally, clinical datasets&mdash;claims and outcomes data&mdash;drove a majority of plan decisions. They all knew what to do with that data. You use it to find members to target for outreach, for instance, and you work to drive member action. You know what levers to pull to maximize revenue and give your members the best experiences and outcomes. Now leaders are needing and collecting different kinds of qualitative data&mdash;social determinants, provider ratings, member satisfaction. Whether or not a member has broadband internet access doesn&rsquo;t show up on claims. There&rsquo;s no measure for the last time a member has eaten.&rdquo;

							<p><strong>Applying AI to patient experience and satisfaction</strong></p><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and how it can be deployed for risk adjustment, member experience and clinical interventions was a frequent areas of focus, as well.&nbsp;<a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/news/how-ai-chatbots-can-boost-patient-engagement-care-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Member engagement applications for AI</a>&nbsp;in particular seemed to be gaining interest this year.</p>						
				
				
				
					
							&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t talk about member engagement today without talking about AI &hellip; how you target members, how you communicate with members, how you interact with providers, how you empower members to drive action &hellip; even how you can predict which members will file complaints and why.&rdquo;

							<p><strong>RISE National wrap-up</strong></p><p>According to our participants, additional subjects that seemed to be everywhere on the docket at RISE National included the changing landscape of risk adjustment, in-home risk assessments and&nbsp;<a href="/hra-outreach-achieves-56-percent-completion-rate-among-dual-eligibles/">increasing the rates of completion for health risk assessments</a>&nbsp;in general.</p><p>The use of digital platforms to solve for member engagement and care coordination issues was also discussed&mdash;with all of the layers of value for health plans, providers and patients. Many attendees stopped by the&nbsp;<a href="/what-we-do/">Carenet Health</a>&nbsp;virtual showcase to talk about the right mix of personal (live) and digital member interaction to accomplish specific goals.</p>						
				
				
				
					
							&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no shortage of challenges and change going on, or disparate ideas and systems poised to help some part of the whole picture. It&rsquo;s going to be interesting to figure out how we all, as an industry, can connect the dots to refine best practices and make healthcare work better for everyone.&rdquo;

							<p>Network steerage really is a good thing. When patients use in-network, high-quality, lowest-cost providers and care facilities, it can have a positive financial impact on a lot of stakeholders&mdash;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/physicians-hospitals-meet-their-new-competitor-insurer-owned-clinics-11582473600?mod=newsviewer_click" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health plans</a>, <a href="https://www.jhconline.com/steering-patients-to-lower-price-hospitals-prompts-others-to-lower-prices.html">benefits managers</a>, provider and health system networks, <a href="/using-member-advocacy-to-plug-costly-leakage-in-medicare-advantage-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medicare and Medicaid plans</a>, employers and the healthcare consumer.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a pretty common industry tactic that, when done ethically and well, can support both cost containment and consumer choice.</p><p>But provider and facility steerage isn&rsquo;t always as successful as it could be.</p><p>Despite the prevalence of <a href="https://www.hfma.org/topics/payment-reimbursement-and-managed-care/article/health-plan-owned-pcp-clinics-steer-members-to-lower-cost-sites-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incentives</a> and <a href="https://www.healthdatamanagement.com/opinion/time-to-reinvent-provider-directories-for-consumers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directories</a>, patients still make decisions that aren&rsquo;t the best for anyone&rsquo;s bottom line. Why? Because without cumbersome (and often consumer-unfriendly) <a href="https://www.hfma.org/topics/payment-reimbursement-and-managed-care/article/administrative-prior-authorization-requirements-increasingly-used-patients-lower-cost.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prior authorization requirements</a>, healthcare consumers can be led to high-cost services based on physician recommendations, even when quality, lower-priced options are readily available in-network and nearby. Patients simply aren&rsquo;t aware they have a choice, or don&rsquo;t remember incentives and directories at the time the need arises.</p><p><strong>The steerage solution: Tackle the problem of awareness with timely outreach</strong></p><p>Take the example of diagnostic imaging facilities. Imaging needs such as X-rays, MRI scans and ultrasounds cost the U.S. healthcare system more than $100 billion annually, according to the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em></a><em>.</em> Additional information from <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Health IT Consultant</em></a></p><p>has shown at least $12 billion of those costs could be avoided. Yet it&rsquo;s not unusual for physician offices to refer patients to a facility without providing any information on different providers&rsquo; cost and quality&mdash;which, by the way, isn&rsquo;t always possible in a busy practice.</p><p>The solution, as with many of healthcare&rsquo;s challenges today, comes down to one-on-one engagement &hellip; and data.</p><p><a href="/exploring-the-value-of-one-on-one-consumer-engagement-in-addressing-healthcares-top-concerns/">&gt;&gt; Editor&rsquo;s note: Download our white paper to learn more about the value of specific types of one-to-one consumer engagement to solve some of the industry&rsquo;s top concerns.</a></p><p>The heart of the steerage approach includes having <a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">trained engagement specialists</a> quickly reach out to any plan member (or employee, etc.) immediately after they have been referred, based on data provided by the physician&rsquo;s office.</p><p>The specialist then can proactively discuss nearby provider and facility options and potential out-of-pocket cost-savings. Via three-way conference calls, engagement specialists can even make the appointments for a truly patient-centric experience.</p><p><strong>An example of proactive RBM network steering</strong></p><p>In one instance working with a radiology benefits manager (RBM), <a href="/about/">Carenet Health</a> deployed a program that leveraged timely data and near real-time outreach to save nearly $1,000 per patient for the RBM.</p><p>By conquering awareness at the point of need, the program more than doubled the alternative approaches being used to steer patients. In fact, 70% of the consumers with whom we engaged selected a lower-price facility for their service than originally suggested by their physician.</p><p><strong>Success equals lower costs AND empowered consumers</strong></p><p>Costs are critical, but proactive network steerage can also help improve your healthcare organization&rsquo;s consumer satisfaction and loyalty scores&mdash;something that&rsquo;s growing in importance <a href="/these-ideas-for-improving-stars-member-experience-scores-may-not-be-on-your-radar-yet-but-they-should-be/">with Medicare Advantage plans in particular</a>.</p><p>In our experience at Carenet, consumers want to be empowered with information that helps them lower their healthcare spending and remain in control. And the more your organization can help them with those needs, the better for all. <a href="/why-joining-the-concierge-movement-is-critical-for-meeting-employer-needs-and-consumer-expectations/">(Learn more about consumer advocacy and navigation assistance here.)</a></p><p><em>Of course, our teams (and our clients) always urge patients to discuss imaging facilities and any quality questions they have with their physician, if they have concerns or questions.</em></p><p><strong>For more information</strong></p><p>If you&rsquo;d like more information on network steerage engagement solutions, please contact our experts via our <a href="/contact/">contact form</a>.</p><p><strong>Want to read more case studies?</strong> <a href="/category/content-type/case-study/">Check out our Resource Center</a>.</p>

							<p>Outsourcing appointment scheduling can be a smart move for many providers and health plans, especially those associated with Medicare and Medicaid programs. <a href="/strategic-engagement-solution-medicare-hedis-gap-closure-success-story/">Annual well visits</a>, lab and other diagnostics, vaccinations&mdash;all of these scheduling issues can overload internal teams.</p><p>Handing scheduling off to external teams that have healthcare and&nbsp;<a href="https://motivationalinterviewing.org/understanding-motivational-interviewing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motivational interviewing experience</a>&nbsp;can not only free up internal teams, but also raise the contact center and engagement performance standards for your organization.</p><p>So how do you find the right&nbsp;<a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">engagement solutions provider</a>, often within a tight timeframe?

This is all about finding out what a vendor can do for you and how they can serve your specific population.</p><p>Vendors should be able to demonstrate that they are committed to creating healthcare experiences that people want to engage with and have proof they&rsquo;ve done this in the past. (<a href="/category/content-type/case-study/">Engagement case studies</a>&nbsp;work well for this purpose.)</p><p>Consider asking the organizations that respond to describe:</p><ul><li>Number of years of experience in&nbsp;<a href="/tag/healthcare-engagement/">healthcare engagement</a>&nbsp;in general and specifically the time spent deploying the type of program you&rsquo;re launching</li><li>Current or past client stories, including outcomes they helped achieve</li><li>Population segments they specialize in (particularly important for&nbsp;<a href="/who-we-serve/health-plans/medicare/">Medicare</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="/who-we-serve/health-plans/medicaid/">Medicaid</a>&nbsp;audiences)</li><li>Their contact outreach strategy, including the touchpoint cadence and number of interactions</li><li>Any&nbsp;<a href="/about/technology/">technology</a>&nbsp;or software platforms that will be leveraged</li><li>How they plan to avoid engagement fatigue and consumer abrasion</li><li>What other languages engagement teams can speak and/or how translation is handled</li><li>Any partnerships they have with third-party vendors that will be used to achieve your program goals</li></ul><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t forget: Ask&nbsp;</strong><strong>about member satisfaction measurement</strong></p><p>How will the responding vendors&nbsp;<a href="https://healthcare.mckinsey.com/measuring-patient-experience-lessons-other-industries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measure the consumer experience</a>&nbsp;during your appointment-scheduling outreach program? How do they gather member/patient satisfaction information related to their scheduling programs?</p><p>You&rsquo;ll want to know that a vendor will have the same commitment to your consumers&rsquo; satisfaction that you do. Transparency in their experience measurement protocols will reveal how they approach this important factor.</p>

							<p><strong>What about healthcare consumer engagement reach and activation rates?</strong></p><p>One of the most challenging parts of healthcare engagement is getting in touch with people. Outreach can be especially tricky because of contact abrasion concerns or contact data quality issues. That&rsquo;s why vendors should be able to explain the techniques and technology they use to successfully contact members. Plus, they need to be able to tell you how they ensure that once a person is reached, they are influenced to take action&mdash;i.e., agree to schedule an appointment, whether via three-way conference calling while they are on the line or another channel.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to ask for a potential partner&rsquo;s overall average reach rate and activation rate (appointments scheduled of those reached). But those rates often don&rsquo;t tell a complete story and can vary greatly depending on a variety of factors. You may be better served to also ask them to provide their average rates by communication channel if applicable, any specific plan populations you&rsquo;re interested in (commercial, Medicare, Medicaid), and audience demographics if important to your project.</p>

					</a>
		
				
				
				
				
							<p>Perhaps most importantly as it relates to performance stats, you&rsquo;ll want to know how vendors plan to <a href="/healthcare-engagement-lab-created-for-clients-rapid-optimization-needs/">improve reach and activation rates during a program, as optimizations are needed</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Another important </strong><strong>factor: Quality assurance</strong></p>
<p>Ask how often potential partners monitor their engagement teams&rsquo; performance (daily, once a week, etc.), How do they hold their teams accountable for ongoing interaction quality?</p>
<p>These are important questions because a well-articulated commitment to providing services as promised is vital to a successful appointment scheduling initiative.</p>
<p>Additionally, ask for information that will tell you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the vendor have a quality management system in place with recording, auditing and coaching tools that assist with continuous process improvement?</li>
<li>Are all calls or other types of communication recorded?</li>
<li>What best practices do they follow to ensure their teams understand their role in quality assurance?</li>
</ul>
<p>In a detailed way, vendors should be able to state how their strategies and management practices ensure the highest levels of consumer satisfaction and engagement.</p>
<p><strong>This is just a start</strong></p>
<p>These are just a few of the areas you&rsquo;ll want to focus on in a comprehensive appointment scheduling RFP.

							<h5>Read the case study to discover how one of the nation&rsquo;s largest Medicare Part D plans improved medication adherence, which was instrumental in supporting its 4-Star CMS rating.</h5><p>When this health plan&rsquo;s leaders wanted to limit gaps in prescription refills&mdash;which would ultimately improve outcomes, lower costs and support key Star measures&mdash;they partnered with Carenet Health to implement a proactive initiative to stop gaps before they happen.</p><p>The data-driven outreach effort leveraged the power of one-to-one conversations to help members who were at risk of non-adherence switch to a 90-day supply of maintenance medications.</p><p>The engagement team&rsquo;s strong member interaction rate resulted in an annual minimum cost-savings of nearly $150 million and much more.</p><p>Simply complete the form below to get details.</p>

							<p>At&nbsp;<a href="/about/">Carenet Health</a>, we&rsquo;ve developed a distinct approach to <a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">healthcare consumer engagement</a>&nbsp;called Intelligent Engagement.<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a comprehensive method based on our decades of engagement learnings, with a strong foundation in data,&nbsp;<a href="/about/technology/">technology</a>, talented teams, and best practices from inside and outside of healthcare.</p><p>It&rsquo;s an agile, scalable and multi-channel approach. But it&rsquo;s not always easy to explain.</p><p>We recently captured a conversation about Intelligent Engagement with three of our Carenet experts, who speak to the methodology every day:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steveharstad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Harstad</a>, Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, and Vice Presidents&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-dreggors-214a7411/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Dreggors</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markureste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Ureste</a>.</p><p><strong>Steve:</strong>&nbsp;Discussing Carenet&rsquo;s Intelligent Engagement is always exciting to me, but it is complex. It&rsquo;s not like a type of tech platform or one, pre-set dialing strategy; it&rsquo;s a truly holistic approach made up of 22 finely tuned elements. No one element is more important than any other. It&rsquo;s the combining of all of those things, in the right way at the right time&mdash;a proprietary combination&mdash;that is our secret sauce.</p><p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note:</em>&nbsp;See the&nbsp;<a href="/about/intelligent-engagement/?et_fb=1&amp;PageSpeed=off">22 elements of Intelligent Engagement here</a>.</p><p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Right. It&rsquo;s like peeling an onion, and each layer matters. It&rsquo;s the combination, the blend of our healthcare expertise, our focus on outcomes and our consumerism DNA. It&rsquo;s that we measure success every hour of every day. Each factor empowers the next. It&rsquo;s the sum of all the parts that makes it unique.</p><p><strong>Steve:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s our infrastructure, it&rsquo;s how we hire, it&rsquo;s how we train, it&rsquo;s how we use technology. Inches equal miles. And culture is everything&mdash;the atmosphere, support, management and all the way to how we are compensated. Principally, Carenet is set up as a &ldquo;sales&rdquo; organization for healthcare. In our facilities, you can feel the energy. It&rsquo;s an energy that quite frankly is different than traditional contact centers, even those at healthcare organizations. We have a unique ability to blend empathy and listening with results and action.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong>&nbsp;I think one of the main points I try to make is that most health plans, for example, have their own internal resources for member engagement. They do what we do, right? Or they have a collection of external partners that do parts of what we do. But we&rsquo;ve found a way to pull it all together into an approach that&rsquo;s special. And that approach will historically improve what plans are doing by at least 15% and often substantially more.</p><p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;The amount of improvement will depend on a lot of variables, such as data hygiene, but you can count on at least a 15% to 20% increase. That&rsquo;s what Intelligent Engagement does.</p>

							<p><strong>Steve: </strong>The average tenure of our clients speaks to that, too. Most have been with us nearly 10 years.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> They know that our method can move the needle.</p><p><strong>Steve:</strong> Our point of reference isn&rsquo;t that we&rsquo;re going to get you a 99% reach rate. No, we&rsquo;re going to improve what you&rsquo;re doing and the value you&rsquo;re getting from consumer engagement. And then refine it and improve it again.</p><p><a href="/healthcare-engagement-lab-created-for-clients-rapid-optimization-needs/"><span style="color: #d31c5b;"><em>Editor&rsquo;s note:</em> Read more about optimization here.</span></a></p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> What we are trying to solve for is <a href="/exploring-the-value-of-one-on-one-consumer-engagement-in-addressing-healthcares-top-concerns/">bigger than a metric</a>. Yes, our metrics are good; our <a href="/category/content-type/case-study/">case studies</a> are impressive. But ultimately, clients hire us to support revenue generation, cost-savings and improving the consumer experience. A lot of stars have to align to make that happen with engagement, and we know how to do that.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> It inspires confidence. We have all of the parts in place. They&rsquo;ve been tested and they are continually improved.</p><p><strong>Steve:</strong>&nbsp;We touch about 70,000 consumers a day. We learn what works and what doesn&rsquo;t, and apply that to all of our engagement strategies.</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> I do think it&rsquo;s rare in our business to really understand the bigger picture while staying hyper-focused on implementing and optimizing the details. Most can do one or the other really well, but not both.</p><p><strong>Steve: </strong>That&rsquo;s a good point. Intelligent Engagement is what allows us to achieve that often-elusive balance. Plus, it&rsquo;s an approach that pinpoints just the right tools for engagement success without&mdash;and this is critical&mdash;member abrasion and fatigue.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> When we have the opportunity to apply all of our best practices, we&rsquo;re unstoppable.</p><p><strong>Steve:</strong> And the end result of those best practices is what we offer that others can&rsquo;t. Ultimately, we seek out opportunities that involve long-term relationships with our clients and significant ROI projections. At Carenet, Intelligent Engagement equals outcomes that enable growth.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to continue the conversation or learn more information about Intelligent Engagement and how it could help your healthcare organization, <a href="/contact/">please reach out</a>.</p><p><strong>PLUS:</strong> You can also <a href="/about/intelligent-engagement/">read more about Intelligent Engagement here</a>, and find additional resources <a href="/tag/intelligent-engagement/">here</a>.</p>

							<p><a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="/what-we-do/advocacy-solutions/page/2/?et_blog">Consumer health advocacy programs</a>&mdash;also known as healthcare navigation assistance and concierge-level member support&mdash;are becoming increasingly valuable to health plans, risk-based providers and employer groups who want to help their members and employees get the most out of their health and wellness benefits.</p><p>That&rsquo;s because giving healthcare consumers what they need to live their healthiest lives is good for everyone&mdash;employees, employers, payers and providers alike. As the name suggests, health advocacy programs are designed to advocate on behalf of patients, help them solve problems and empower them to make more informed healthcare decisions. Programs can include a wide range of services, everything from <a href="/7-key-steps-for-successfully-onboarding-and-cultivating-member-relationships/">health plan member onboarding</a> to <a href="/high-performance-outsourcing-health-coaching-program-achieves-remarkable-81-engagement/">health coaching</a> to care coordination to follow-up support.</p><p>For many health plans, outsourcing their advocacy program to an external partner is a cost-effective way to provide this personalized health plan customer service. When payers use an external partner, their members get a dedicated team to help them understand and navigate the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/the-next-wave-of-healthcare-innovation-the-evolution-of-ecosystems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complex healthcare ecosystem</a>, and payers can leverage advanced technology and the ability to scale a program to meet changing demand.</p><p>Knowing <a href="/what-types-of-questions-can-a-health-advocate-or-health-plan-concierge-answer/">the kinds of questions a health advocate can answer</a> is a good place to start when choosing a health advocacy services partner. Health plans should also have questions that drill down on the partner program&rsquo;s specific features for member advocacy&mdash;asking potential vendors everything from whether or not a solution can be white-labeled for a seamless plan or employer experience to how (or if) the program can be customized.</p><p>With studies indicating about 50% of consumers won&rsquo;t move forward with care or wellness actions once they hit a roadblock, details like these become critical to offering a successful program. What&rsquo;s more, employers are turning to advocacy programs to help them manage costs, most notably by offering employees advocacy support for getting second-opinions, managing chronic conditions and resolving disputed claims and surprise bills, according to the <a href="https://www.shrm.org/pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Society for Human Resource Management</a>.</p><p><a href="/advocacy_partner_comparison_guide/"><img class="wp-image-19363 size-medium alignleft" style="padding-right: 30px !important;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How_To_Compare_Advocacy_Partners_Guide_13NOV20-1583x2048-1-232x300.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="300"></a><br>To help you find the best health concierge partner for your health plan (and it&rsquo;s okay if that right-fit partner is not us), we&rsquo;ve put together a list of questions we recommend you consider asking potential vendors in our <strong>Advocacy Partner Comparison Guide.</strong> We&rsquo;ve included the first three questions below. To see the full list and gain other tips and insights, please <a href="/advocacy_partner_comparison_guide/">download the complete guide</a>.</p><p><strong>QUESTION 1</strong></p><p><strong>What will the navigation support look like to members?</strong></p><p>As healthcare consumers, members will expect the same kind of convenience they&rsquo;re already getting in other areas of their lives. It&rsquo;s important to find out what combination of digital and live-support <a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">engagement services</a> are offered and how easily members can access them.</p><ul><li>Is support available 24 hours a day/seven days a week, or only during typical business hours?</li><li>Will members always be able to speak with a live person when they call?</li><li>Is there one point of access for finding advocate support?</li><li>Can the advocacy program be integrated with other employee benefits and programs?</li><li>Will members work with the same advocate throughout one problem or need?</li></ul><p>Look for a partner that understands the full range of member experience touchpoints in a consumer&rsquo;s typical healthcare journey, from gaining awareness of plan benefits and participating in wellness programs to needing <a href="/the-4-es-health-plans-need-to-know-to-improve-medication-adherence/">medication adherence</a> support. A high level of knowledge and integration across programs will likely deliver the best member experience.</p><p><strong>QUESTION 2</strong></p><p><strong>Can the advocacy program be customized?</strong></p><p>After assessing your health plan&rsquo;s resources and both members&rsquo; and employers&rsquo; needs, you&nbsp;probably have a good idea where you have <a href="/why-joining-the-concierge-movement-is-critical-for-meeting-employer-needs-and-consumer-expectations/">advocacy and service gaps</a>.</p><p>Consider factors like:</p><ul><li>What kinds of questions do you want advocates to be able to answer for members?</li><li>Are you looking to add clinical support for members to an existing program you already have in place?</li><li>Do you have a program for chronic condition management but need something to help members find support after a difficult diagnosis or a surprise medical bill?</li></ul><p>Seek out a partner that is flexible enough to be able to customize your program, so you purchase only the services your plan needs.</p><p><strong>QUESTION 3</strong></p><p><strong>Who can utilize the advocacy program&rsquo;s services?</strong></p><p>With so many employees today having to manage care for aging parents, this can be a not-so-surprising sticking point. It&rsquo;s important to find out if employees can use an advocate, for instance, to help with things like arranging Meals on Wheels or transportation to physician appointments for family members.</p><p>If services are available only to members and enrolled dependents, a vendor&rsquo;s program may be too limited for your employer group needs.</p><p><strong>More about the&nbsp;connection&nbsp;between&nbsp;healthcare consumer-centricity and navigation services</strong></p><p>As the industry continues to <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20210119.724670/full/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shift toward consumer-driven, value-oriented healthcare</a>, health plans are rethinking how they do business with both employer groups and consumers.</p><p>To remain competitive, progressive plans are adopting a consumer-first mindset that elevates the overall healthcare experience while curbing costs for all stakeholders. <a href="/exploring-the-value-of-one-on-one-consumer-engagement-in-addressing-healthcares-top-concerns/">Advocacy and navigation member services</a> will be an important part of that shift.</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t stop here</strong></p><p>You can find more questions you should ask and what features to consider when choosing an advocacy partner in our <a href="/advocacy_partner_comparison_guide/"><strong><em>Advocacy Partner Comparison Guide: What Health Plans Need to Ask Before Choosing a Program Vendor</em></strong></a><em>.</em> The guide includes a useful worksheet for comparing those who respond to your RFP.</p><p>PLUS: Be sure to browse our other <a href="/category/content-type/ebooks/">guides and ebooks</a> on our Resource Center.</p>

							<p>Pinpointing and addressing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/social-determinants-of-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social determinants of health</a> (SDOH) is a growing concern for both payers and providers&mdash;identifying those factors can help optimize the health of the member/patient base and ultimately change lives. Awareness of and outreach for social determinants are especially important for&nbsp;<a href="/who-we-serve/health-plans/medicaid/">managed Medicaid plans</a>&nbsp;and provider networks,&nbsp;<a href="/who-we-serve/health-plans/medicare/">Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans</a>, and all types of&nbsp;<a href="/who-we-serve/provider-solutions/">risk-based healthcare providers</a>.</p><p>The impact of SDOH on patient health and outcomes is widely known, and solving for social determinants of health can also affect financial bottom lines. Studies show addressing the factors and removing obstacles to care can result in a 30% per person&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/social-determinants-shown-reduce-healthcare-spending" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduction in overall healthcare costs</a>.</p><p>In addition,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2017/05/what-is-health-equity-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advancing health equity</a>&nbsp;and tackling health disparities&mdash;critical missions in healthcare today&mdash;require stakeholder collaboration for identifying and solving for SDOH. Even before the pandemic, social determinants were having a major impact on health outcomes&mdash;especially for the most vulnerable populations. Consider:</p><ul><li>There is a direct link between the&nbsp;likelihood of smoking and lower income.</li><li><a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/racism-bias-discrimination/health-disparities-stress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stress related to disparities</a>&nbsp;has a direct link to health.</li><li>Chronic exposure to social and environmental stressors often results in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3863696/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biological &ldquo;wear-and-tear&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;that places individuals at higher health risk.</li><li>Lack of transportation, health literacy, employment, childcare and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/viewpoint-internet-access-is-a-super-determinant-of-health-that-must-be-expanded.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internet</a>&nbsp;influence care access.</li></ul><p>Most SDOH efforts begin by collecting actionable, risk-factor data that can illuminate the stumbling blocks and inform intervention efforts. That data may come from self-reporting, claims, census or enrollment databases. Psychographics, health status information, patient behavior and demographics&mdash;including ZIP code&mdash;should all play a role. Predictive analytics can then be used to find potential high-risk consumers who need a little extra help.</p>						
				
				
				
							<h4>Some of the key areas of focus we&rsquo;re seeing in the industry right now include:</h4><ul><li>Health literacy</li><li>Healthy food availability</li><li>Secure and safe housing</li><li>Employment</li><li>Transportation</li><li>Healthcare access and connectivity</li></ul>						
				
				
				
							<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at how specific patient engagement-related strategies can help your healthcare organization <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://patientengagementhit.com/news/using-social-determinants-of-health-in-patient-centered-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up its SDOH intelligence</a> and stay in touch with consumers to recognize needs effectively and efficiently.</p><p><strong>Communicate early and often.</strong> A <a href="/optimized-member-engagement-one-plans-journey-to-fewer-silos-and-better-results/">multi-step and multi-channel engagement strategy</a> can help uncover SDOH issues and work to solve for them over time. More frequent healthcare consumer engagement&mdash;from live phone calls and interactive voice response (IVR) to email and text messaging&mdash;is a great way to nurture connection and build trust with health plan members and patients. The more comfortable they feel as early in your relationship as possible, the more receptive they may be to your help.</p><p><strong>Make the most of health risk assessment outreach.</strong> Health information and assessment outreach can be a vital first step in establishing rapport and fostering transparency and accountability. Carenet Health data has shown that <a href="/the-power-of-personal/">human-anchored health risk assessments</a> deliver more powerful needs identification versus passive digital surveying methods alone. When connected with trained engagement specialists, or in some cases registered nurses, individuals respond more openly to one-on-one interaction. Through conversational probing and motivational interviewing methods, an outreach team can explain the impact of lifestyle issues, communicate the availability of valuable resources and help with next steps. (<a href="/hra-outreach-achieves-56-percent-completion-rate-among-dual-eligibles/">See a case study on this topic here</a>.) If non-live engagement tactics are used, keep in mind that long surveys are an instant barrier to gaining the information you need, as are complex questions.</p><p><strong>Show seniors some extra TLC</strong>. <a href="/two-things-medicare-advantage-plans-can-do-social-determinants-of-health/">Tackling social determinants of health in seniors</a> often starts with personal outreach in the form of <a href="/one-on-one-check-ins-are-engagement-lifesavers-for-seniors-during-the-pandemic/">one-on-one check-ins</a>. From assisting older consumers in navigating benefits eligibility and enrollment to approaching sensitive topics such as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/aging/pdf/mental_health.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anxiety and depression</a>, a little care and concern for their well-being can go far. Formalizing your senior outreach plans and implementing them strategically is also key.</p><p><strong>Lean into telehealth as a touchpoint. </strong><a href="/an-overlooked-strategy-how-on-demand-telehealth-can-unlock-better-star-ratings/">Engagement via telehealth utilization</a> is often an overlooked SDOH strategy. In addition to eliminating transportation and childcare barriers, <a href="/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">24/7 telehealth</a> connections (via care coordinators, registered nurses and online physician consults) can explore obstacles and discuss situations that might be impacting a person&rsquo;s health. Their need for on-demand care can be a useful jumping-off point to larger needs discussions.</p><p><strong>Prepare for language barriers. </strong>Communication is great, but if it&rsquo;s not in a language that&rsquo;s understood, it&rsquo;s worthless. Plan for multi-lingual translators and translations as needed for your populations.</p><p><strong>Make SDOH</strong><strong> a post-discharge priority.</strong> After a patient is discharged from a hospital or care facility, reviewing and addressing social determinants of health can help prevent ED visits and impatient readmissions. It sounds like a logical and necessary step, but it&rsquo;s one that often goes unheeded by both health plans and providers. Does the person have a strong social network, access to healthy food and a plan for <a href="/testing-of-nurse-based-medication-adherence-strategy-produces-positive-results/">medication management</a>? Asking questions about their lifestyle and resources, and <a href="/nurse-advice-line-delivers-satisfaction-and-roi/">offering solutions within their reach</a> can be a huge step in promoting positive health outcomes and keeping costs low for all.</p><p><strong>Continually tweak the SDOH conversation</strong>. When initiating consumer engagement regarding SDOH, ensure your team members and/or healthcare engagement vendor are going above and beyond to garner open, honest responses and gently encourage solutions. Discuss why preventative care is so important. Employ <a href="/beyond-engagement-strategies-for-persuasion-and-influence/">proven activation tactics</a>. Optimize your scripts with strategic testing and analysis. <a href="https://patientengagementhit.com/news/what-is-the-best-strategy-for-social-determinants-of-health-screens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supplement patient SDOH screening</a> with additional data sources and community resources.</p><p><strong>Integrate data and technology systems. </strong>Addressing SDOH requires personalization for heightened individual relevance, and that requires data. Plus, effective leveraging of data requires data integration. To make SDOH a priority, connections between systems also need to be a priority, whether it&rsquo;s working in the electronic health record or patient portal, or tapping <a href="https://www.redoxengine.com/blog/care-coordination-vendors-addressing-social-determinants-of-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">care coordination platforms or digital transportation marketplaces</a>. Once you&rsquo;ve captured data on health determinants, be sure to utilize that insight for better risk segmentation, targeted scripting and versioned calls to action.</p><p><strong>Follow up, then follow up again. </strong>Providing information on how to get assistance isn&rsquo;t enough to truly solve for SDOH. Helping individuals with follow-through is just as essential. A patient or plan member with substantial social and healthcare needs may not have the ability or resources to move forward after a referral, especially if they encounter any impediments. <a href="/what-we-do/advocacy-solutions/">Health navigation advocates</a> can help patients and health plan members move through the often-confusing networks of available social and healthcare services, which can vary by individual, region, insurance and state.</p><p>These are just a few ideas to fuel your SDOH strategies and planning. To learn about other ways healthcare consumer engagement can address and help solve urgent challenges such as SDOH needs, download our white paper, <a href="/exploring-the-value-of-one-on-one-consumer-engagement-in-addressing-healthcares-top-concerns/"><em>The Value of One-on-One Engagement in Addressing Healthcare&rsquo;s Top Concerns</em></a><em>,</em> or <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> to learn more about Carenet Health&rsquo;s engagement work.</p>

We sat down with <a href="/about/meet-the-team/">Vikie Spulak, Carenet Health Chief Client Officer</a>, to discuss Carenet&rsquo;s role now that COVID-19 vaccines are available, and how critical <a href="/8-ways-health-plans-can-transform-member-relationships-in-a-covid-19-world/">consumer engagement</a> fits into an accessible and successful mass vaccination strategy.</p><p><span style="color: #d31c5b;"><strong>Q: Let&rsquo;s start with the &ldquo;what.&rdquo; In what ways are Carenet teams assisting with the first phases of COVID-19 vaccine distribution?</strong></span></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Our <a href="/carenet-assisting-with-operation-warp-speeds-initial-covid-19-vaccine-distribution/">first call for help</a> came as some of America&rsquo;s largest retail pharmacies were charged with getting the COVID-19 vaccine to our nation&rsquo;s skilled nursing facilities. We&rsquo;re helping to schedule onsite vaccination clinics for that very vulnerable population and the staff who work at those facilities&mdash;tackling everything from parking logistics to patient registration to reminder and follow-up calls.</p><p>In addition to those outreach communications, we&rsquo;re also helping clients with scheduling the all-important in-person appointments for the <a href="https://www.wellmedhealthcare.com/vaccine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first phases</a> of the general public vaccinations&mdash;seniors over 65.</p><p><span style="color: #d31c5b;"><strong>Q: Are there additional engagement-related initiatives in the planning stages? </strong></span></p><p><strong>A:</strong> We&rsquo;re also having discussions about other types of appointment scheduling, education and outreach. We&rsquo;re fortunate that we can stand up solutions and scale them quickly, whether it&rsquo;s one-on-one conversational engagement that can help motivate hesitant individuals to move forward with getting the vaccine, quick messages reminding patients of the importance of the second dose, or providing information via push channels, like interactive voice response (IVR) messaging.</p><p>We can also engage our <a href="/what-we-do/clinical-solutions/">clinical team via telehealth</a> for support for pre- and post-vaccination needs. There are a lot of ways we can help, and different strategies and channels we can use.</p><p><span style="color: #d31c5b;"><strong>Q: It sounds like the pairing of phone outreach and digital communication tactics is a priority.</strong></span></p><p><strong>A:</strong> In a perfect world, the healthcare industry is going to be using the best of what&rsquo;s available&mdash;text-to-schedule, online portals, automated reminders and personalized, human connection that we know works when it comes to emotional decisions. We anticipate working closely with more partners as next-phase distribution plans are formalized and organizations have a clearer understanding of their role.</p><p>As we&rsquo;re seeing with our work in getting seniors vaccinated, having online appointment scheduling is great, but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily deliver equal access. Those without internet service or smartphones, or those who might need technical support or who have questions about the vaccination process, need access to appointments and information, too. If the nation wants to reach the success rates we&rsquo;re all hoping for, we have to think about outreach and communication in terms of specific population needs.</p><p><span style="color: #d31c5b;"><strong>Q: Are there other factors organizations should be aware of as they plan for engagement with their populations?</strong></span></p><p><strong>A:</strong> I think planning has to include some of the lessons we&rsquo;ve learned in our decades of work with healthcare consumers in closing their gaps in care &hellip; in making those hard-to-think-about and easy-to-put-off appointments. Using the <a href="/beyond-engagement-strategies-for-persuasion-and-influence/">principles of persuasion and motivation</a> to move these important conversations from &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it&rdquo; to &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it&rdquo; will be important as we move down the lists of those eligible for COVID-19 vaccines.</p><p>We should all be continually optimizing from what we learn after each day to help individuals overcome their fears&mdash;and break down their barriers. What changes in scripts are needed for this population? Would a different channel perform better? Removing barriers might be as simple as arranging for transportation to a vaccine clinic site. Or there could be cultural beliefs or health literacy issues to address.</p><p>At Carenet, we&rsquo;ve established ways to handle these situations from our past experience, and we&rsquo;re learning quickly what will work and what won&rsquo;t for this particular vaccine distribution. Tailoring outreach to the population will continue to be critical.</p><p><span style="color: #d31c5b;"><strong>Q: What does it mean to Carenet Health team members to be working on vaccine scheduling and distribution programs?</strong></span></p><p><strong>A:</strong> The pandemic has affected us all emotionally, and ultimately, this work is different because of the scale of the efforts and the scale of the pandemic. We understand the importance &hellip; the difference for our clients, the difference vaccination can make in people&rsquo;s lives and in getting our society back to some kind of normal. Our teams are really honored to be asked to help, and we&rsquo;re honored to partner with our clients to make these programs happen. We have teams working days and nights, teams working a great deal of overtime to make these initiatives successful. We&rsquo;re all thankful for their commitment.</p><p>I think all of these efforts become even more meaningful when we hear sincere words of thanks from those patients we&rsquo;ve had the privilege of helping. They are just so relieved. Of course, we feel this in our typical outreach work, but it&rsquo;s all magnified right now.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>For more information on <a href="/resource-center/">healthcare consumer engagement best practices</a> or Carenet&rsquo;s work with COVID-19-related education and outreach, <a href="/contact/">please contact us today</a>.</p>

							<p>In our <a href="/2021-healthcare-consumer-engagement-forecast/">recent<em> Healthcare Consumer Engagement Forecast</em></a>, we predicted that <a href="/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">telehealth</a> is absolutely here to stay, but considerable transitions lie ahead in terms of growth, infrastructure and scope.</p><p>Out of pandemic necessity, the adoption of all types of telehealth has already increased dramatically. Around-the-clock telephonic nurse advice has become invaluable. Many individuals are trying on-demand virtual physician consults for the first time. Provider practices are embracing telemedicine.</p><p>Will this mean a slow and steady continued growth of telehealth? Let&rsquo;s break down our thoughts about telehealth and its emerging role as an integral part of healthcare delivery strategies.</p><p><strong>Consumer use of on-demand, 24/7 telehealth in particular will continue to increase&mdash;and expand to other areas of on-demand care.</strong></p><p>Once consumers experience the convenience of telehealth for appropriate kinds of care, there&rsquo;s little impetus to go back to the way things were. All signs point to increased adoption&mdash;but not at the rate experienced in <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-07-13/telehealth-continues-rapid-growth-amid-coronavirus-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March through May 2020</a>. After the initial spring surge, utilization of on-demand Virtual Clinics has continued to see spikes; some of our clients at <a href="/what-we-do/">Carenet Health</a> have experienced double-digit percentage growth in use over last year.</p><p>However, an <a href="https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/telehealth-stocks-how-to-invest-in-the-future-of-digital-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 2020 report</a> found the acceleration of telehealth adoption, including on-demand urgent care, could mean that $250 billion of current U.S. healthcare spending will soon be virtualized. Plus, we already know that 24/7 telehealth can deliver cost-savings for both the patient and the payer due to unnecessary care avoidance&mdash; offering further incentive.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why we expect to see further expansion and healthcare consumer interest in areas like:</p><ul><li>On-demand <a href="/the-emerging-role-of-health-plans-in-behavioral-health-crisis-services/">virtual mental health support</a></li><li>All-virtual preventive and primary care</li><li>24/7 <a href="/what-we-do/clinical-solutions/">chronic care management support</a></li></ul><p>To support further growth, the industry will need to make some changes, though&mdash;including moving away from a one-size-fits-all mindset. Not everyone will want to see their dermatologist via telehealth about an uncomfortable skin infection, for instance, but are fine interacting about a simple rash via virtual care. Not all telehealth will need to be video-based, which will solve for <a href="https://www.americantelemed.org/industry-news/one-in-10-americans-use-telehealth-but-nearly-75-lack-awareness-or-access-j-d-power-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connectivity and user technical limitations</a>; in fact, audio, email/portal exchanges and other channel options may be adequate.</p><p>Different needs and likes among populations and healthcare needs will need to help drive the patient-centric options and changes needed.</p><p><strong>Consumer education, encouragement and assistance will be needed to sustain telehealth growth. </strong></p><p>A <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/consumer-health-trends.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent poll</a> showed that 80% of consumers who have had a telehealth visit would choose to have another. Generation Z and millennials in particular are eager to continue with virtual care at 86% and 83% respectively. A large portion (88%) of those with chronic disease plan to continue, as well.</p><p>On the other hand, baby boomers may need more support to reach that level of optimism. The <a href="https://www.healthyagingpoll.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 National Poll on Healthy Aging</a> found that not all seniors view virtual care as an adequate substitute for in-office care. <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/telehealth-new-normal-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gender also plays a role</a>; men are more likely to use telehealth today than women.</p><p><a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2020-us-telehealth-satisfaction-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research from J.D. Power</a> released in October 2020 found high consumer awareness of telehealth (75%), but more than half (54%) of consumers citing a lack of understanding whether their health plan covers telehealth services.</p><p>Payers, providers and telehealth partners will need to work together to keep the momentum going, and to educate and support consumers.</p><p>In particular, the industry will need to consider response strategies that help bridge the gap between interest and successful use of telehealth by seniors. A&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2020/11/4-strategies-to-make-telehealth-work-for-elderly-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent study</a>&nbsp;by Harvard Business School found that seniors who have impairments related to vision or hearing can struggle with telehealth and may benefit from devices provided by their providers or payers. Others may need one-on-one training.&nbsp; (Some great ideas are covered in this <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/11/4-strategies-to-make-telehealth-work-for-elderly-patients?ab=hero-subleft-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Harvard Business Review</em> article</a>.)</p><p><strong>Costs&mdash;who pays for what kinds of telehealth and how much&mdash;will need attention. </strong></p><p>The <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/trump-administration-finalizes-permanent-expansion-medicare-telehealth-services-and-improved-payment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent news from CMS</a> about the finalization of the Physician Fee Schedule, which includes an addition of 144 telehealth services covered by Medicare, marks a pivotal moment for virtual care. Many states are also working toward improving telehealth reimbursement policies. A <a href="https://www.cchpca.org/sites/default/files/2020-10/CCHP%2050%20STATE%20REPORT%20FALL%202020%20FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from the Center for Connected Health Policy shows that all 50 states and the District of Columbia have some form of Medicaid reimbursement for telehealth in their public program. However, most industry associations agree more action is needed.</p><p>In addition, commercial and Medicare Advantage plans in particular, will need to consider lowering some telehealth copays or even eliminating them for consumers. Traditional healthcare organizations will soon <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/strategy/walmart-s-key-healthcare-moves-in-2020-a-timeline-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encounter rising competition</a> from new and non-traditional players that will offer free or low-cost virtual care opportunities.</p><p>Healthcare consumers will have their say, too. A <a href="https://patientengagementhit.com/news/telehealth-patient-satisfaction-high-paves-path-for-future-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study published in July</a> found that 50% of patients surveyed said they would consider changing providers if affordable and convenient telehealth wasn&rsquo;t offered. More than 20 percent said they would access telehealth on a limited basis even if their insurance didn&rsquo;t cover it. <a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/covid-19-benefits-one-reason-consumers-chose-medicare-advantage-plan-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medicare Advantage plan purchasers</a> have also indicated telehealth coverage was important to them during enrollment this fall.</p><p><strong>Telehealth&mdash;when smartly integrated with other services&mdash;will continue to reduce overall costs for the healthcare system. </strong></p><p>Any time a patient can use on-demand telehealth versus in-person care (emergency, urgent, primary office care) for an appropriate health need, payers, risk-based providers and their members save money. Placing a registered nurse in front of on-demand physician consults&mdash;<a href="/for-sustainable-telehealth-growth-we-need-to-talk-smarter-resource-management/">the Carenet model</a>&mdash;can save additional money, as treatment guidance by an RN costs less than care from a licensed physician.</p><p>Nurses can triage nearly 700 adult and pediatric conditions, and our estimates show that a &ldquo;nurse first&rdquo; approach can save healthcare organizations up to 67% over a direct-to-econsult infrastructure. This type of approach may also serve as a gatekeeper for appropriate use of telehealth and fraud prevention.</p><p>Telehealth will be especially important for organizations interested in <a href="/how-to-improve-your-health-plans-ed-diversion-strategy/">unnecessary emergency care visit avoidance</a>. Each time a patient enters the emergency department (ED) with a condition that can be treated in a primary care setting, it comes at an average cost of $2,032 to the healthcare system, according to an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/newsroom/posts/2019-07-22-high-cost-emergency-department-visits.html?cid=IC:UHG:OA:7.22.19:standard:NAT:Newsroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis</a>&nbsp;published by UnitedHealth Group.</p><p>Taking it a step further, inpatient admissions that often result from an ED visit&mdash;up to 18% often do, says the <a href="https://www.edbenchmarking.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emergency Department Benchmarking Alliance</a>&mdash;could also be avoided with a more robust telehealth infrastructure. (The average cost of an inpatient admission now exceeds $22,000, according to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/funding-and-services-needed-achieve-universal-health-coverage-applications-global" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this study</a>.)</p><p><strong>Progress will ultimately come down to the patient experience.</strong></p><p>Yes, the pandemic pretty much forced telehealth into the spotlight. And yes, the future seems bright&mdash;with innovations, investments and improvements on the horizon. But like any other service in the modern world, user experience will eventually determine how the future of virtual care plays out.</p><p>Will healthcare disruptors like Amazon, which understand consumerism better than most, set the bar? Will payers and providers partner in new ways that benefit the virtual experience for their patients and members?</p><p>As your healthcare organization plans for the future amidst continued uncertainty, it will be critical to focus on that patient experience. Those who do, and who can differentiate their services, will be in the best position a year from now.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>To read more predictions from Carenet Health engagement experts, <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/970eecbb-29d8-4345-87f7-03b3ee7088b0.pdf">download our complete forecast</a>.

							<p>We often say the magic of healthcare engagement happens on a micro level&mdash;one-on-one connections, for instance, that can close a preventive care gap, which ends up changing a life.</p><p>But sometimes, healthcare engagement has the opportunity to play a role that changes millions of lives in a short period of time&mdash;<strong>helping to protect an entire, vulnerable population and ultimately change the trajectory of a nation.</strong></p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/explaining-operation-warp-speed/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operation Warp Speed</a> and the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program, the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) and <a href="https://www.dod.mil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Defense</a> have partnered with national retail pharmacies to provide and administer COVID-19 vaccines to residents of long-term care facilities nationwide. The pandemic has taken a devastating toll on long-term care facility residents, and these residents, in addition to those professionals who care for them, are one of the highest priority groups to be offered the first available COVID-19 vaccines.</p><p>To remove the burden of additional outreach and planning from pharmacists, <a href="/">Carenet Health</a> is helping to manage the engagement and scheduling arm for part of the program with 30,000 long-term care facilities across the U.S.</p><p>The Carenet Operations Team estimates the initial work of our engagement specialists on the project could help facilitate the deployment of at least 2 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine by the end of the first quarter of 2021.</p><p>Pharmacists will conduct three vaccination clinics over approximately two months at each long-term care facility that opts into the initiative: an initial clinic, a clinic for the second (booster) vaccination needed to complete the regimen, and a follow-up clinic to ensure all affiliated with the facility (and who wish to get the vaccine) have received their two doses.</p><p>A specially trained Carenet team is performing a series of scheduling and planning outreach touchpoints with long-term care facilities, including confirming numbers of vaccine doses required for each event and providing information on what will be necessary for the clinics to be a success, such as requirements for a reserved onsite space, pre-registrations, and privacy and security.</p><p><a href="/about/meet-the-team/">Vikie Spulak, Carenet&rsquo;s Chief Client Officer</a>, said the organization has worked with health plans and pharmacies on other vaccination clinic needs in the past, but this project certainly includes a heightened level of urgency.</p><p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re asked to serve as part of an unprecedented life-saving initiative like this, it&rsquo;s reassuring that we have the technology, processes and experts in place to ensure we get it right,&rdquo; Spulak said. &ldquo;Our infrastructure and operations structure is key. It&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re able to ramp up quickly and cost-effectively, yet maintain the empathy-driven engagement our teams are known for.&rdquo;</p><p><a href="/about/meet-the-team/">John Erwin, Carenet Health CEO</a>, said this is a rare opportunity to see the difference that engagement can make on a grand scale. &ldquo;These vaccination clinics are essentially the first steps in turning the tide on the COVID-19 pandemic. We&rsquo;re honored to be a part of this historic initiative, to relieve some of the burden on pharmacies and public health authorities, and to help make this happen for some of the nation&rsquo;s most vulnerable.&rdquo;</p><p>The Pharmacy Partnership for Long-term Care Program is being offered free of charge to all long-term care settings, including skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, residential care homes and adult family homes. For more information on the partnership, read the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/10/16/trump-aministration-partners-cvs-walgreens-provide-covid-19-vaccine-protect-vulnerable-americans-long-term-care-facilities-nationwide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HHS news release</a>.</p><p>For more information on Carenet&rsquo;s role, please reach out to Skip Dampier, VP &ndash; Marketing, at <a href="mailto:sdampier@carenethealthcare.com">sdampier@carenethealthcare.com</a>.</p>

							<p>This year has been a rough road for far too many Americans and far too many in healthcare. The COVID-19 pandemic demanded a lot from all of us. Providers, payers, their partners and healthcare consumers &hellip; everyone was forced to pivot in unforeseen ways, including how care was delivered and accessed, and how rapidly evolving information was communicated and received.</p><p>A look back over the past 12 months of blog posts on the <a href="/resource-center/">Carenet Health Resource Center</a> is a study in how subsets of the healthcare industry&mdash;those most interested in healthcare consumer engagement&mdash;were challenged. It&rsquo;s also a study in how those challenges were addressed.</p><p>Below, we&rsquo;ve gathered the top-10, most-read blog posts of 2020, covering important topics from the quick rise of telehealth to COVID-19-related outreach to Medicare Advantage Star ratings.</p><p>Take a look&mdash;and check out the ones you may have missed.</p>

							<p>Not that long ago, epidemiologists were likely the only ones discussing terms like social distancing, quarantine or super-spreader events on a regular basis. But now governments, businesses and schools are facing the patient engagement struggles scientists, public health experts and healthcare organizations understand only far too well.</p><p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, everyone was suddenly asked to adopt new ways of interacting: stay at home, <a href="https://masks4all.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wear masks in public</a>, keep 6 feet apart, avoid large gatherings, use hand sanitizer, the list goes on. In a short period of time, motivating organizations to implement&mdash;and people to follow&mdash;recommended health and safety guidelines became a crucial tool in stopping the spread.</p><p>While the pandemic is <a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-influencing-consumer-healthcare-behavior-and-some-changes-may" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already changing healthcare consumer behavior</a> in ways that are expected to last long after the health crisis is over, the general public may still need convincing that a quickly developed <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/just-beautiful-another-covid-19-vaccine-newcomer-moderna-succeeds-large-scale-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine</a> is safe. About 40% of Americans aren&rsquo;t willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine according to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/325208/americans-willing-covid-vaccine.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November Gallup poll</a>.</p><p>To influence consumer confidence and entice people to schedule vaccinations, healthcare organizations will have to understand the needs that drive human behavior like never before. One positive aspect of being nine months into a pandemic? There&rsquo;s valuable behavioral data for developing effective patient engagement strategies.</p><p>At <a href="/">Carenet Health</a>, we&rsquo;re anticipating healthcare organizations will make leveraging those data insights a priority&mdash;to ultimately design more effective <a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">healthcare engagement</a> initiatives.</p><p>Here are just a few of the questions the industry will be considering with a fresh perspective:</p><ul><li>What really motivates people to participate more fully in their own health? In wellness and care management programs?</li><li>How should engagement work differ across generations?</li><li>What are the current barriers to engagement success?</li><li>How can the latest technology help influence behavior?</li><li>What do new consumer behavior science theories mean for healthcare?</li></ul><p><strong>Lessons in healthcare consumer behavior from the pandemic</strong></p><p>American consumers now seem more willing to take an active role in the healthcare system, according to a recent study from&nbsp; <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/covid-19-consumer-behavior.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PwC&rsquo;s Health Research Institute</a> (HRI). <a href="/whats-next-for-telehealth-market-forces-and-8-action-steps-you-need-to-know/">Telehealth quickly moving into the mainstream</a> shows how readily consumers are adapting to change and adopting new care delivery options.</p><p>But as you might expect, the HRI study revealed that some consumers are forgoing care during the pandemic, with attitudes and behaviors related to things like <a href="/the-4-es-health-plans-need-to-know-to-improve-medication-adherence/">medication adherence</a> being affected. In the study, 22% of consumers reported they had already made or were planning to make adjustments to their spending on medications, with 9% saying they planned to save money by stopping medications altogether.</p><p>Another consumer behavior being affected? Online engagement. Before the pandemic, healthcare organizations might have expected low responses to the emails they sent to members. But according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianswinscoe/2020/04/28/attention-marketers-and-customer-experience-leaders-here-is-how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-changing-customer-behavior/?sh=6377eb817742" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a>, both email engagement and conversion levels are on the rise during the health crisis. Online shopping, including purchases of health and wellness items, has also been booming with <a href="https://www.digitalstrategyconsulting.com/online-advertising/ad-tech/nearly-half-of-online-sales-for-brands-in-march-were-from-new-customers/47906/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">43% of all online sales for brands in the U.S. in March being driven by new customers</a>.</p><p>More time spent at home and in front of screens is most likely fueling greater comfort levels with digital interactions. Consumers have adapted quickly to new ways of shopping like online grocery ordering. There&rsquo;s never been a better time for healthcare organizations to embrace and improve digital communication channels to drive patient engagement.</p><p>For health engagement to be effective, however, healthcare organizations will need to pay attention to a wide range of factors, including the consumer&rsquo;s age, their <a href="/stories-healthcare-engagement-plays-key-role-in-helping-organizations-calm-fears-and-deliver-care-during-covid-19-pandemic/">fears</a>, even the current political climate. A multi-pronged approach based on behavior science will be key.</p><p><strong>Leveraging behavior science to help drive effective activation</strong></p><p>Whether it&rsquo;s getting a brand-new vaccination during a pandemic or managing a chronic condition, consumers usually need ongoing encouragement to make positive health changes.</p><p>In the post-pandemic world, healthcare organizations won&rsquo;t just be able to invest in new technology and communication channels. They&rsquo;ll need to truly understand how <a href="/beyond-engagement-strategies-for-persuasion-and-influence/">persuasion principles, motivational readiness and activation</a> all work together to drive success.</p><p>At Carenet, we follow a five-step process to achieve this success, as outlined in the chart below. The first step is, of course, engagement. To get consumers to get a vaccine, for example, healthcare organizations will need to communicate where and when the vaccine is available and explain the benefits of getting it &hellip; and do that across multiple communication channels.</p>

							<h5 class="landing_gray_subhead">Read our engagement case study to learn how one Medicare Advantage plan took member satisfaction to new heights, beating past scores by 13% and achieving a substantial return on investment.</h5><p>In this Carenet Health case study, we highlight four factors that helped one large Medicare Advantage plan remove engagement silos with a more personalized, multi-touch strategy for one-to-one member outreach. The new approach impacted efforts such as onboarding, health assessments, closing gaps in care, wellness program enrollment and medication adherence.</p><p>The results: Improved satisfaction and quality scores, an estimated 3:1 ROI and financial impact of $52 million annually&mdash;with lifetime savings well over $700 million.

							<p>SAN ANTONIO, Texas, November 16, 2020 &ndash; When it comes to healthcare consumer engagement, 2020 will be remembered as a race to adapt to the quickly evolving demands of the pandemic. Now healthcare organizations are preparing for 2021 with the help of Carenet Health&rsquo;s just-released <em><a href="/2021-healthcare-consumer-engagement-forecast/">2021 Healthcare Consumer Engagement Forecast</a>.</em></p><p><a href="/">Carenet Health</a>, one of the nation&rsquo;s largest providers of 24/7 telehealth and healthcare engagement solutions, produces this forecast each November to help <a href="/">health plans, health systems and other healthcare service organizations</a> stay informed of the emerging trends around the healthcare consumer. These trends often touch on topics such as changes in the digital and mobile health spaces, how to better motivate patients to close gaps in care, new paths to improving Medicare Advantage member experience ratings and more.</p><p>This year&rsquo;s forecast includes eight key predictions for the coming year:</p><ol><li>Telehealth is here to stay, but considerable transitions lie ahead for adoption, infrastructure and scope.</li><li>A surge in at-home services will further solidify the home&rsquo;s status as a preferred care setting.</li><li>The need for whole-person care and engagement will reach a boiling point, and Medicare Advantage plans will set the pace.</li><li>More attention will be given to the engagement value equation.</li><li>Access to 24/7, cost-effective care and information will be essential.</li><li>Every facet of the healthcare industry will be working harder to address social determinants of health.</li><li>Health plans will trade single outreach touchpoints for holistic and unified strategies that put the member at the center of all communications and service developments.</li><li>Behavior science will be on everyone&rsquo;s radar.</li></ol><p>Carenet <a href="/about/meet-the-team/">CEO John Erwin</a> said it&rsquo;s important to remember there is no new state of equilibrium yet for healthcare engagement. That&rsquo;s why further cultivating both the ability to adapt and the flexibility to scale efforts will be vital. &ldquo;Providers and payers alike will need to stay on top of shifting consumer needs more than ever before&mdash;even those that have little to do with COVID-19, like routine pediatric vaccinations and Medicare wellness visits. The organizations most in tune with those sometimes fast-changing needs will find themselves in a stronger position,&rdquo; Erwin said.</p><p>###</p><p><strong>About Carenet Health&nbsp; </strong></p><p>Carenet Health is one of the healthcare industry&rsquo;s leading consumer engagement and telehealth partners&mdash;providing member and patient engagement, clinical support, virtual care and advocacy solutions on behalf of 250+ of the nation&rsquo;s premier health plans, providers, health systems and Fortune 500 companies. One in five Americans have access to Carenet&rsquo;s services.</p><p>Carenet is headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, with additional campuses in New Mexico, Maine and the Philippines.

							<p>Advancements in digital health and logistics technology have investors flocking to non-traditional and remote care startups. Mobile healthcare engagement via apps and text messaging are gaining significant ground. Wearables are getting smarter every day.</p><p>And these trends were taking off well before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.</p><p>So it&rsquo;s no surprise that just as <a href="/telehealth-will-soon-be-as-ordinary-as-online-banking/">telehealth may soon become as ordinary as online banking</a>, in-home healthcare services are opening the digital health front door wider than ever before.</p><p>Care provided outside of facility settings&mdash;in a patient&rsquo;s home&mdash;is expected to increase considerably in a short amount of time, according to <a href="https://www.homecaremag.com/home-health-legislation-regulation/why-homecare-answer-2020s-big-health-care-questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>HomeCare</em> magazine</a>. Hospital-at-home care, modern house-call wellness visits, voice- and sensory-activated remote monitoring, behavioral health visits, medication reconciliation, nutrition support and preventative care test kits are just some of the in-home services available now that were once only via inpatient care.</p><p><strong>Trends affecting healthcare delivery</strong></p><p>What&rsquo;s fueling the rapid adoption of in-home healthcare services? Cost-savings for payers, providers and consumers, and convenience for patients are two driving factors. Add in the coronavirus pandemic, which may require a longer-term, &ldquo;safer-at-home&rdquo; lifestyle for many, and it makes sense from a public health perspective, too.</p><p>At the same time, U.S. health plans are preparing for a &ldquo;silver tsunami,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/silver-tsunami-coming-healthcare-time-prepare#:~:text=The%20aging%20population%20is%20not,will%20be%20smart%20to%20embrace." target="_blank" rel="noopener">when older people will outnumber children for the first time</a>, in just under 10 years&rsquo; time. Organizations with risk-based contracts, particularly <a href="/high_touch_solution_boosts_medicare_advantage_engagement_and_star_rating/">Medicare Advantage (MA) health plans</a>, are an especially good fit for home-based care.</p><p><strong>Healthcare engagement a vital part of success</strong></p><p>As health plans and their members begin to rely more on in-home healthcare services, Carenet Health expects the emphasis on effective engagement&mdash;and how it can support moving care from the office to the home&mdash;to increase, as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Advances in this market have the potential to shake up the mix of how care is delivered,&rdquo; explains <a href="/about/meet-the-team/">Chief Growth and Strategy Officer Steve Harstad</a>. &ldquo;That will require new relationship-building strategies.&rdquo;</p><p>That&rsquo;s because everyone&mdash;caregivers, plans, providers and consumers&mdash;will likely be asked to use digital health tools at some point. In just about every type of <a href="/when-crisis-demands-innovation-remote-patient-monitoring-boosts-inpatient-capacity-and-helps-covid-19-patients-avoid-readmissions/">remote patient monitoring</a> situation, for example, consumers will need guidance, clinicians will need access and the lines of communication will need to remain open. And <a href="/8-ways-health-plans-can-transform-member-relationships-in-a-covid-19-world/">smart engagement strategies</a> can help improve everything from enrollment, adoption and activation to utilization and follow-up.</p><p>In fact, for remote patient monitoring, for instance, to become the norm, engagement will be crucial. Patients are naturally going to have fears, challenges, barriers and questions, whether about the technology, program, instructions or clinical oversight.</p><p>Health plans and providers will need to educate patients about their expected role and ultimately build their confidence. In addition to coordinating the ordering and delivery of any necessary home equipment, they will need to help patients and caregivers (often virtually) set up sometimes-sophisticated technology. And of course, there will need to be ongoing clinical and tech support, plus positive reinforcement and reminder communications to ensure patients continue to participate in their care at home and in some case submit the necessary data.</p><p><strong>Engagement can also help bridge generational gaps&nbsp;</strong></p><p>While health plans are gearing up to transition at least some inpatient services to be delivered at home, consumers, particularly older adults, have some concerns.</p><p>Only 50% of all consumers are comfortable using at-home diagnostics, according to a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/consumer-health-trends.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 Survey</a> by Deloitte Center for Health Solutions. For instance, 48% of Gen Z and millennials, versus 28% of seniors, say they feel confident using at-home blood tests.</p><p>The most pressing issue for health plans? Those who might benefit most from in-home care are the most likely to need help using it. Healthcare engagement programs that educate, encourage and offer support will be needed to help ensure the boom in at-home healthcare services continues.</p><p>The rise in at-home care and its relationship to new patient engagement needs is one of our top eight predictions discussed in our <em>2021 Healthcare Consumer Engagement Forecast</em>.

							<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, a top priority for individuals was finding trusted partners and sources of information who could help them understand what their next steps should be and how to protect their own health, as well as that of their loved ones.</p><p>But as the pandemic emerged, widespread confusion became common. Many <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2767633" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physician offices were forced to temporarily close</a> their doors, public health advisories weren&rsquo;t always consistent or easily found, shelter-in-place orders were issued, and there was an overall reduction in quick access to care and information. It wasn&rsquo;t unusual for people to become increasingly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nazbeheshti/2020/05/28/10-eye-opening-statistics-on-the-mental-health-impact-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isolated and stressed</a> and in need of a reliable source of patient guidance.</p><p>That&rsquo;s when numerous health plans and healthcare organizations took quick action to step up and step in&mdash;to adapt and fill the void with targeted outreach efforts. For support in creating and implementing these turnkey initiatives, the organizations turned to <a href="/who-we-serve/">Carenet Health</a>.</p><p>Carenet&rsquo;s strategic experts acted swiftly, as well&mdash;leveraging the company&rsquo;s <a href="/what-we-do/">industry-leading services</a> and infrastructure, along with a highly skilled engagement workforce, to provide rapid assistance and program deployment. Working collaboratively with various partners, Carenet implemented more than 20 COVID-19-related initiatives over a 90-day period, including programs focused on:</p><ul><li>New telehealth care services via a <a href="/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">Virtual Clinic or nurse advice and triage</a></li><li>Health plan-to-provider outreach</li><li>Pharmacy engagement and medication adherence programs</li><li><a href="/one-on-one-check-ins-are-engagement-lifesavers-for-seniors-during-the-pandemic/">Senior isolation telephonic check-ins</a></li><li>Outreach to high-risk members to ensure they were getting the care they needed</li><li>Automated messaging that delivered updated COVID-19 information</li><li><a href="/when-crisis-demands-innovation-remote-patient-monitoring-boosts-inpatient-capacity-and-helps-covid-19-patients-avoid-readmissions/">Remote patient monitoring support</a></li><li>Proactive appointment setting and portal assistance for telehealth visits</li><li><a href="/the-emerging-role-of-health-plans-in-behavioral-health-crisis-services/">Virtual mental health crisis support</a></li></ul><p>Following are just six examples that illustrate how Carenet worked with clients to optimize new outreach initiatives and healthcare engagement in support of changing (and vital) care and information needs.</p><blockquote><p><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #D31C5B;"><strong>Example 1: A breath of fresh air </strong></span></p></blockquote><p>As the pandemic was picking up speed across the nation, a large health plan wanted to implement phone wellness check-ins with their 5,400 Medicare members who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This outreach effort went from concept to launch in a two-week span, thanks to the organization&rsquo;s long-time partnership with Carenet.</p><p>Over a 12-day period, Carenet&rsquo;s empathy-trained team personally connected with nearly 40% of the targeted population with information and support. To help keep members safe, our engagement specialists ensured all contacted members had access to at least a 30-day supply of medications and encouraged utilization of virtual care. This effort also helped the health plan demonstrate compassion and care, and develop a stronger relationship with these at-risk members&mdash;who were grateful for the calls.</p><blockquote><p><span style="color: #D31C5B; font-size: x-large;"><strong>Example 2: A welcome exchange </strong></span></p></blockquote><p>A new Medicare Advantage health plan wanted to provide personalized support to its new members, as well as create loyalty and trust by providing scientifically based COVID-19 health and safety information. The company quickly asked Carenet&mdash;which had been busy making welcome and onboarding calls to their members&mdash;to pivot and develop a pandemic-specific outreach effort.</p><p>Carenet&rsquo;s engagement team contacted over 50% of the health plan&rsquo;s members to not only complete member onboarding but also provide support and CDC-approved safety guidelines for COVID-19. In addition, the team assisted members in scheduling virtual physician visits and activating mail-order prescriptions. Members reported high satisfaction for the outreach and praised the plan for making the connection and providing critical information during a stressful time.</p><blockquote><p><span style="color: #D31C5B; font-size: x-large;"><strong>Example 3: All in one: Addressing fears, closing gaps and boosting satisfaction</strong></span></p></blockquote><p>Another growing health plan also leveraged its well-established partnership with Carenet to communicate with its Medicare members during the pandemic. One of the plan&rsquo;s ongoing outreach efforts, which was initially designed to close gaps in care and improve HEDIS<sup>&reg;&nbsp;</sup>measures, was rapidly expanded to check in with members about their needs and fears during the pandemic.</p><p>The program immediately resulted in high satisfaction rates and abundant positive feedback from members. Carenet&rsquo;s engagement team achieved a 69% reach rate and a 43% conversion rate in scheduling HEDIS-related appointments, even during the pandemic. Additionally, the effort supported the plan&rsquo;s <a href="/the-2021-cms-star-ratings-are-here-what-do-they-mean-for-your-member-engagement-strategies/">Stars and CAHPS improvement initiatives</a> while making sure members have all the medications and other healthcare support they need.</p><blockquote><p><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #D31C5B;"><strong>Example 4: In touch and out of isolation </strong></span></p></blockquote><p>A healthcare organization that served a large Medicare-aged population on the West Coast wanted to stay in touch with their members during the pandemic to assess and address social determinants of health (SDOH) and determine if isolation was creating any unmet mental or physical health needs. The organization partnered with Carenet, whose engagement specialists conducted an outreach campaign that evaluated each member&rsquo;s access to nutritious food, availability of medications and basic supplies, and quality of social connections with family and caregivers.</p><p>Carenet&rsquo;s team learned that the need was greater than anticipated: Many of these seniors were no longer receiving support or visits from home aids or family members due to a shelter-in-place order. Thanks to this outreach, Carenet connected 60% of the targeted members to local foodbanks and provided one in five with COVID-19 information or services. Carenet&rsquo;s outreach team also coached members on how to access telehealth resources like nurse advice lines and virtual physician consultations if they started showing any symptoms of COVID-19.</p><blockquote><p><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #D31C5B;"><strong>Example 5: Medication management outreach to the rescue </strong></span></p></blockquote><p>One of the nation&rsquo;s largest healthcare organizations found that pandemic-related closures were causing serious medication-related repercussions for individuals. Since many doctors&rsquo; offices were closed or operating during limited hours, prescription refill authorizations were being delayed. That meant some individuals weren&rsquo;t able to get their medications refilled at a pharmacy in a timely manner and were running out of critical medications.</p><p>The organization turned to Carenet, who reached out to both providers and patients to problem-solve. In many cases, patients were offered courtesy 30-day refills to help patients and providers until lockdowns were lifted, physician practices were able to open with COVID-19 safety protocols or telehealth could be used for prescription renewal visits. This outreach proved substantially effective with 70% of the contacted individuals opting for a courtesy medication refill to maintain medication adherence.</p><blockquote><p><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #D31C5B;"><strong>Example 6: Telehealth care with SDOH connections </strong></span></p></blockquote><p>A healthcare organization in a large state wanted to launch a telehealth nurse advice line to serve the estimated 2.7 million uninsured residents during the COVID-19 pandemicTurning to Carenet for support, the organization&rsquo;s leaders were pleased when the virtual care effort launched within two weeks&mdash;in time to serve the state&rsquo;s surge of COVID-19 cases.</p><p>Carenet&rsquo;s telehealth registered nurses not only successfully triaged symptoms and guided individuals to the next best step for care, they also provided information on where to find local and free COVID-19 testing and even arranged transportation if necessary.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p><strong>Learn more about how Carenet Health can help your organization. </strong>Timely, informative and compassionate engagement and telehealth initiatives proved their worth during the pandemic, helping health insurers and other payer and provider organizations support members&rsquo; and patients&rsquo; health and wellness needs, ease their fears, boost loyalty and improve outcomes.

							<p>Last week and just ahead of open enrollment, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) released its annual <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/high-quality-care-medicare-beneficiaries-continues-medicare-health-and-drug-plans-receive-star" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star ratings</a> for Medicare Advantage Part C and Part D plans.</p><p>While the COVD-19 pandemic certainly impacted the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/2021starratingsfactsheet-10-08-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 </a><a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/2021starratingsfactsheet-10-08-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMS Star Ratings</a>&mdash;some carried-over 2020 data was one factor&mdash;weight shifts and a large number of &ldquo;too new&rdquo; plans were also part of the mix.</p><p>Some of the most notable stats included:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/medicare-advantage-enrollees-in-4-star-or-higher-plans-to-drop-in-2021/586706/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A majority (77%) of Medicare Advantage enrollees</a> will be in a four-star or higher plan in 2021&mdash;but that&rsquo;s down from 81% last year.</li><li>Only 17% of enrollees will be in stand-alone drug plans rated four stars or higher.</li><li>28 plans&mdash;one more than last year&mdash;were awarded the highest rating of five stars.</li></ul><p>Each year&rsquo;s Stars release also has implications for how plans will need to approach <a href="/best-practices-for-5-star-health-plan-member-engagement/">member engagement strategies</a> in the days ahead. Of course, plans with disappointing scores will need to dissect the causes for lower-than-hoped-for individual measures and develop strategies to improve. In addition, there are several universal takeaways:</p><p><span style="color: #D31C5B; font-size: x-large;"><strong>Competition continues to heat up, making stand-out member engagement essential</strong></span></p><p>With 2021 Medicare Advantage premiums <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/cms-touts-dip-in-medicare-advantage-premiums-for-2021/585890/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected to be the lowest in 14 years</a><u>,</u>many plans adding new types of enticing benefits and 212 MA-PD contracts listed as &ldquo;too new to be measured,&rdquo; heightened competition is certainly on the radar.</p><p>Established plans can expect the newer plans to pursue out-of-the-gate higher scores with a focus on consumer-centric operations and member services. In their quest to become five-star rated plans, these newer players will be looking for ways to take <a href="/8-ways-health-plans-can-transform-member-relationships-in-a-covid-19-world/">health plan consumer engagement</a> to the next level, build long-term trust with members, address any barriers to wellness and <a href="/an-overlooked-strategy-how-on-demand-telehealth-can-unlock-better-star-ratings/">simplify access to both care and plan information</a>.</p><p>Whether they&rsquo;re an established plan or a new kid on the block, every plan will want to make engagement optimization a priority moving forward&mdash;including refining contact strategies, channels and approaches that limit outreach fatigue and abrasion.</p><p><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #D31C5B;"><strong>Addressing medication adherence remains important</strong></span></p><p>With <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/26/people-skipping-medically-necessary-drugs-because-they-cost-too-much.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least one-third of Americans</a> not taking their medications as prescribed, medication adherence has continued to impact Star ratings. This year, the average medication-related MA-PD measure score dropped, while the Statin Use in Persons with Diabetes (SUPD) measure&mdash;triple weighted for the first time&mdash;dropped .4 stars on average.</p><p>Plans looking to have a competitive Stars advantage will need to sharpen their focus on <a href="/the-4-es-health-plans-need-to-know-to-improve-medication-adherence/">improving adherence levels</a> well beyond simple refill reminders. Taking time to understand the reasons why a member isn&rsquo;t taking their medication is a good first step. Plans should also consider strategies to:</p><ul><li>Engage with people via live phone outreach (with multi-channel follow-up as needed) regarding their medication goals, needs and preferences. Our years of experience shows us how effective one-to-one personal connections can be for the Medicare population. (<a href="/testing-of-nurse-based-medication-adherence-strategy-produces-positive-results/">Read this interesting mini-case study here</a>.)</li><li>Identify and assist with any social determinants of health that may be at play.

							<p>In a market where quality measures and patient satisfaction are critical, many Medicare Advantage plans form highly refined networks. After all, a smaller network of providers is both easier to manage and easier to influence to improve the overall <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="/tag/member-experience/">member care experience</a>. And better member experience can support improved <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="/best-practices-for-5-star-health-plan-member-engagement/">Medicare Advantage CMS Star ratings</a>, which in turn impact revenue and payment and enrollment patterns.</p><p>Often designed to leverage a health plan&rsquo;s existing relationships with health systems or provider groups in targeted regions, narrower networks can also reduce unnecessary and avoidable utilization. They do this by helping members get the care they need in the most streamlined and convenient way, at the lowest cost.</p><p>While these cultivated networks can be attractive to members because they offer a lower premium versus wider networks, they can also result in challenges for consumers and for plans&mdash;like out-of-network leakage. That&rsquo;s not surprising, since a <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/99414/why_do_medicare_advantage_plans_have_narrow_networks.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report from the Urban Institute</a> found that narrow care networks often include less than one-third of the eligible clinicians in an area.</p><p><span style="color: #D31C5B; font-size: x-large;"><strong>Network leakage and fragmented patient care </strong></span></p><p>One important issue with network leakage is that it can negatively impact the very thing narrow networks hope to support&mdash;quality of care. Medical reports, imaging and lab results, and other important patient history information are often not as easily accessible to out-of-network specialists. Plus, the relay of this information can take longer because processes may not be in place to quickly transfer these records out-of-network.</p><p>Another challenge: Decisions made during an out-of-network physician visit aren&rsquo;t always captured in the in-network electronic health record (EHR) software. This skews the health system&rsquo;s clinical alignment and makes it difficult for in-network physicians to have access to the latest information necessary to coordinate patient care.</p><p>The resulting fragmentation between the in-network physician and out-of-network providers (and the health plan) can result in miscommunication, delays in diagnosis or care, duplication of services and denied referrals. In some cases, this fragmentation has even led to <a href="https://www.perfectserve.com/blog/patient-referral-leakage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">malpractice claims</a>.</p><p><span style="color: #D31C5B; font-size: x-large;"><strong>Networks leaks are costly, too</strong></span></p><p>So what does network leakage translate into for healthcare organizations? A <a href="https://fibroblast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Patient-Leakage-A-new-survey-highlights-high-costs-limited-control-October-2018-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey of healthcare executives</a> found:</p><ul><li>Four out of 10 reported they lose at least 10% of annual revenue due to network leakage; one in five said they lose up to 20%.</li><li>One in five of the execs also don&rsquo;t understand exactly where the leakage is occurring or why it happens.</li><li>Another interesting point: Almost one in four organizations do not track or quantify patient leakage.</li></ul><p>Out-of-network care decisions can negate potential Stars increases and ultimately lead to a consumer&rsquo;s decision to change insurance plans.</p><p><span style="color: #D31C5B; font-size: x-large;"><strong>Finding&mdash;and addressing&mdash;the leakage points with health advocacy</strong></span></p><p>Most healthcare organizations face <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/care-coordination/reducing-leakage-four-places-leadership-can-look-to-plug-the-holes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four primary leakage points</a>: member/patient awareness, physician referrals, care coordination and ease of use of in-network providers.</p><p>The good news is that each of these network leakage points can be addressed by heightened member services or <a href="/what-we-do/advocacy-solutions/">health advocacy</a> (also called healthcare navigation or <a href="/what-does-health-plan-member-advocacy-look-like-in-action/">health plan concierge-level service</a>).</p><p>Let&rsquo;s break it down:</p><p><strong>Lack of awareness:</strong> Just as plans and health systems are sometimes not aware of leakage, members and patients are often not aware of their options and how much the different options may cost them. <a href="/what-types-of-questions-can-a-health-advocate-or-health-plan-concierge-answer/">Health advocates</a> can proactively provide upfront education and information, and guide members through the process of either staying in network or finding their lowest cost option and easier coordination out of network. This can be done at several points in the <a href="/7-key-steps-for-successfully-onboarding-and-cultivating-member-relationships/">member-plan relationship</a>: during member onboarding, when provider data indicates a referral is being issued, or after an out-of-network claim is processed to prevent additional leakage.</p><p>This type of approach pays off. Carenet helped one plan <a href="/healthcare-consumer-engagement-facility-steering-strategy-achieves-11-5-million-in-annual-savings/">save nearly $1,000 per patient by steering screenings to high-quality, low-cost diagnostic imaging facilities</a> that were in-network.</p><p><strong>Physician referrals: </strong>Health plans are increasingly leveraging their utilization management expertise to help in-network provider groups and health systems understand leakage and referral patterns and their cost drivers. <a href="/health-plan-concierge-programs-can-be-a-critical-competitive-advantage/">Healthcare advocates</a> focused on provider-plan relations can take this one step further by providing insights into longitudinal care across systems.</p><p>Additionally, providers and plans can work together to create data-driven, triggered outreach when a flag indicates a member has been referred for out-of-network services.</p><p><strong>Care coordination:</strong> Here&rsquo;s where health advocacy can really shine, taking on the often-complex array of tasks that are needed for seamless member care coordination. Advocates can help members with the all-important in-network provider selection, research different providers&rsquo; appointment availability and quality measures scores, help with medical record transfers, assist with lab/imaging and specialist appointment scheduling and more.</p><p>Healthcare navigation specialists are also typically trained to communicate with members who have fragmented care teams to resolve issues. They can especially help those who have not identified a primary care physician&mdash;solving for potential leakage before it happens.</p><p><a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/out-network-primary-care-tied-rising-aco-costs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One study</a> found that decreasing the percentage of primary care delivered out-of-network, across all Medicare accountable care organizations, by just one-tenth of a percentage point could save the Medicare system $45 million annually.</p><p><strong>Ease of use:</strong> With a concierge-level advocate as a resource for members, using in-network providers is made easier. Advocates can be a guide to finding the right providers and facilities with just one portal chat, text or phone call. And again, advocates can serve as a conduit between in-network providers and the health plan to ease any points of potential friction in terms of ease of use.</p><p>This can be particularly important for members who may also need social determinants of health addressed. In fact, leakage <a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/out-network-primary-care-tied-rising-aco-costs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tends to be higher</a> in marginalized communities and among minority patients. This may be due to the fact that those populations have a more difficult time maintaining continuity of care and experience more barriers to seeing the same primary care provider repeatedly.</p><p>Health advocates can also be a key part of a leakage prevention program that identifies members with at-risk member experience scores and proactively engages them to improve their ease-of-use satisfaction by listening and problem-solving.</p><p><em>Post content provided by the Office of the Chief Growth and Strategy Officer at Carenet Health.</em></p><p>&mdash;</p><p><strong>Learn more</strong></p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to talk more about <a href="/a-turning-point-in-the-complex-intersection-of-consumer-needs-changing-care-access-and-advocacy/">advocacy and navigation programs</a> and how they can address network leakage and improve Star ratings, <a href="/contact/">contact us today</a>.

							<p>If there&rsquo;s one population that could really reap the benefits of telehealth, it&rsquo;s seniors.</p><p>Not having to travel to a doctor&rsquo;s office, avoiding unnecessary exposure to COVID-19 and other viruses, saving money with lower-cost virtual care, and being able to get 24/7/365 medical attention in the comfort of their home&mdash; these are just a few of the reasons that telehealth makes good sense for those over 65 (and the healthcare organizations that serve them). It&rsquo;s one more way for health plans and providers to offer the Medicare population modern, effective and convenient care.</p><p>Plus, when Medicare Advantage plans get telehealth right for seniors, it can improve member experience and outcomes, leading to higher <a href="/infographic-2021-23-stars-changes-and-impact-analysis/">CMS Star ratings</a>, and significantly boost member loyalty. <a href="/survey-data-reveals-insights-into-patient-satisfaction-for-nurse-advice-line-services/">Studies also show</a> that the more people use telehealth and have good experiences, the more they&rsquo;ll use it&mdash;which means a healthier Medicare population overall.</p><p><strong>Wait, aren&rsquo;t seniors already using telehealth?</strong></p><p>According to a recent survey from <a href="https://www.healthinsurance.com/learning-center/article/medicare-eligible-seniors-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthinsurance.com</a>, the overall number of seniors using <a href="/">telehealth services</a> has increased 300% during the pandemic. But that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it&rsquo;s been working well across the board. Another <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2768772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> found that 38% of seniors were not ready for video visits due to a lack of experience with technology. Even telephone visits can create a barrier for roughly 20% of the older population because they may have difficulty hearing, struggle with communicating or be experiencing symptoms of dementia.</p><p><strong>So, what&rsquo;s the path forward for Medicare members and telehealth?</strong></p><p>Enter the power of <a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">healthcare engagement</a>. A little outreach legwork can go a long way in helping your senior population leverage all that telehealth can offer. Eventually, they may even turn to virtual care as their first-thought, every-time option. Here are three tips to consider for success:</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>1. Educate seniors about telehealth <em>before</em> they need it.</strong></p><p>Your first step is to use any and every opportunity to proactively educate your Medicare population on what telehealth is, how it can be used and what the benefits are in their lives. Use all of your member/patient touchpoints&mdash;open enrollment, new member kits, portals, apps, emails, text messages, one-on-one live outreach and interactive voice response (IVR) messaging.</p><p>It may be helpful to provide short, instructional videos with closed captioning; video patient testimonials; and information on how to prepare in advance for a virtual visit.</p><p><strong>2. Engage your Medicare population and address their barriers to telehealth usage.</strong></p><p>Again, proactive steps are key. Put a person-to-person, live outreach calling plan in place to contact members/patients (prioritize by highest-risk) to have a discussion about telehealth. During the conversation, you&rsquo;ll want to evaluate the individual&rsquo;s access to necessary technology and gauge the senior&rsquo;s understanding of how to use it, as well as their willingness to try virtual care. It&rsquo;s also a good chance to address any difficulties with hearing or vision that could impact the success of a video visit.</p><p>Your outreach plan can even include scheduling telehealth appointments in advance for preventive and maintenance care.</p><p><strong>3. Make telehealth easy for seniors to access.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Healthcare consumers of all ages can be confused by how to get the virtual care they need. Do they call their health plan&rsquo;s nurse advice line? Do they start with an online search of an on-demand physician service? Do they contact their primary care provider first?</p><p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s critical to provide simple instructions and one point of access. Offering a single point of contact&mdash;via a live person to speak to who can answer questions&mdash;has been shown again and again to be helpful, especially for Medicare plan members.</p><p>That initial conversation can be the stress-free starting point for whatever care is needed&mdash;nurse guidance, a physician e-consult or mental health support. This way, seniors get fast, convenient guidance and direction to the most appropriate level of care, too. And that reduces unnecessary primary, urgent and emergency care and related costs for all.</p><p><strong>What about getting things right <em>during</em> the telehealth care visit? </strong></p><p>At <a href="/what-we-do/">Carenet Health</a>, our clinical team takes extra care to ensure seniors have a positive, successful and <a href="/delivering-a-personal-and-meaningful-telehealth-experience-takes-skill-guided-by-these-7-steps/">meaningful telehealth experience</a>. We talked to our operations experts and experienced registered nurses on the telehealth frontlines about what needs to happen when a senior call comes in to our nurse triage call center. Following is what they said; use these tips to help your health plan or practice teams work with the Medicare population, too.</p><p><strong>&gt; Listen for cues.&nbsp;</strong>Our nurses are skilled at being fully present when taking a telehealth call from a senior. Depending on the individual&rsquo;s situation, they may not be forthcoming about not being able to hear you or won&rsquo;t speak up if there&rsquo;s something they don&rsquo;t understand. As one Carenet nurse shared: &ldquo;There are situations where I can tell by their tone or the way they are responding that they may not have understood what I&rsquo;m asking or didn&rsquo;t hear me.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>&gt; Ask questions in different ways.&nbsp;</strong>If a misunderstanding is suspected, one Carenet nurse said she approaches the situation with alternative language. &ldquo;I will ask the question in a different way to see if I get the same response.&rdquo; Another Carenet nurse chimed in, &ldquo;If I feel like someone isn&rsquo;t understanding my questions or advice, I try an alternative word or phrase&mdash;and try to provide a simpler definition.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>&gt; Speak slowly and clearly, not necessarily loudly.&nbsp;</strong>Speaking louder isn&rsquo;t always a good solution in working with someone who may have hearing issues. But being mindful of the tone of your voice and speed of your sentences <em>can</em> be an important element of ensuring a positive experience.</p><p>Carenet nurses are trained to adjust frequently, not to interrupt, and to slow down and speak as clearly as possible.&nbsp;A Carenet nurse offered this insight:&nbsp;&ldquo;When it seems there&rsquo;s an issue with communication, I&rsquo;ll talk more slowly and enunciate important words.&rdquo; Another nurse said, &ldquo;I keep my sentences short and simple. And I&rsquo;m always willing to repeat myself if needed. It feels good to show them that their call is important to me.&rdquo; And another nurse approaches the situation this way: &ldquo;I always test my voice by asking &lsquo;is this loud enough? or too loud?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Senior calls may take longer, and Carenet operations works that knowledge into our service level and resource planning.</p><p><strong>&gt; Use another person as an amplifier.&nbsp;</strong>Sometimes older individuals who are struggling with hearing over the phone can have a better experience if there&rsquo;s someone with them who can repeat the information. One of our RNs said, &ldquo;It really helps when there&rsquo;s somebody else there who can repeat the questions. If the patient doesn&rsquo;t have someone nearby, I will offer to conference in a family member or friend to help.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>&gt; Ask patients to repeat important points.&nbsp;</strong>Standard teaching methods often remain a good way to ensure understanding during virtual care encounters, too. &ldquo;If I have any reason to think they may not understand me,&rdquo; explained a Carenet RN, &ldquo;I simply ask them to repeat the question or the care instructions&mdash;whatever the important information is&mdash;back to me, so I can be sure they are clear on next steps.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>&gt; Embrace the storytelling.&nbsp;</strong>It&rsquo;s not unusual for seniors to communicate through stories. Although it takes time, our nurses understand the value of listening not only to the story itself, but for the backstory that helps them read between the lines. Many times, there is a connection to the patient&rsquo;s care need, and listening intently goes a long way in building the necessary telehealth-born relationship. As one Carenet RN said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really all about making them feel cared about and heard.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>&gt; Set aside the stereotypes.&nbsp;</strong>It&rsquo;s vital to remember in every engagement situation, including in a virtual care environment, that all seniors are not the same. The Medicare population is a varied one, with a wide range of ages, life experiences and abilities. All seniors are not lonely and scared. They&rsquo;re not all struggling with technology. Many have used telehealth before. They don&rsquo;t all have memory, cognitive or hearing issues. As one of our RNs said, &ldquo;Seniors are probably the most diverse age group that I engage with. Each one has their own story and distinct needs.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>How can we help?&nbsp;</strong>Our teams have been working in the telehealth and Medicare engagement space for decades, and are continually updating our best practices. <a href="/contact/">Contact Carenet Health</a>&nbsp;today to discuss how we can help optimize your telehealth solutions for seniors and other specific populations.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>Want to read more?

							<p>With hospitals at capacity in some parts of the nation during the current pandemic, healthcare organizations are focusing on taking proactive steps to help members and patients remain healthy and at home. This is especially true for individuals who are recently discharged from the hospital, since many in this population are often at-risk for re-admittance.</p><p>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jgs.15244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 study</a> found that one in five Medicare beneficiaries experience a hospital readmission within 30 days after discharge. Unplanned readmissions cost the United States an estimated $17 billion. Research also shows that <a href="https://psnet.ahrq.gov/primer/readmissions-and-adverse-events-after-discharge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 75% of these types of events</a> could have been avoided. Many return trips to the hospital are caused by adverse drug events, an especially problematic issue among patients with low health literacy, complex medication regiments or prescriptions of high-risk medications.</p><p><strong>Reconciling differences</strong></p><p>Now more than ever, healthcare organizations need to ensure that members understand their medication instructions and that medications are coordinated effectively during the gap between a hospital stay and the first visit to a physician after discharge. That&rsquo;s where medication reconciliation processes hold promise in reducing drug-related readmissions, according to a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11096-020-01040-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> published in the <em>International Journal of Clinical Pharmacy</em>.</p><p>So when one healthcare organization needed an efficient and effective way to communicate with recently hospitalized members about their new medication list, they turned to <a href="/what-we-do/clinical-solutions/">Carenet Health</a>.</p><p>Together, the partners worked to develop a medication reconciliation process that tested the value of medication reviews with a select member population. A key component of the process was the role of &nbsp;Carenet Health registered nurses (RNs). (<a href="/the-4-es-health-plans-need-to-know-to-improve-medication-adherence/">Learn more about how our RNs work with patients on medication adherence</a>.)</p><p>Our experienced nurses contacted individuals who had been discharged from the hospital after suffering a defined major cardiovascular issue, such as a heart attack, to check in with the individual, discuss new medications and pinpoint any possible duplicate therapies. They also asked questions relating to any adverse medication reactions that might be occurring and gauged the person&rsquo;s understanding of the purpose of the new medications and educated them as needed. Finally, the nurses provided encouragement for continued adherence to their medication schedules and doctor&rsquo;s appointments.</p><p><strong>Refilling health</strong></p><p>The data from this initiative showed that the majority of individuals&rsquo; adherence to recommended medication treatment increased after the engagement with an RN compared to a control group with no RN contact. In addition, adherence continued several months post-discharge.</p><p>The test of the process also revealed several opportunities for improvement in the outreach program, and areas where more testing would be beneficial to refine the process.</p><p>For more insights on medication adherence, download our ebook on <a href="/overcoming-barriers-the-faces-of-medication-nonadherence/">overcoming medication adherence barriers</a> today.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re interested learning more&mdash;particularly creating and testing (or testing and refining) a healthcare engagement strategy&mdash;please <a href="/contact/">reach out to our experts</a> to start the conversation.</p>

							<p>Last week, <a href="/about/">Carenet Health</a> hosted a <em>Mapping the Stars 2020 Virtual Collaboration</em> for a select group of Medicare Advantage health plan and Stars program leaders from around the nation. The interactive event featured a discussion led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rexwallace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stars expert and consultant Rex Wallace</a>, with a segment also provided by David Dodge, Medicare Stars program director at <a href="https://www.cambiahealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cambia Health Solutions</a>.</p><p>Participants discussed the current uncertainty in Stars planning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, then focused on what the market knows right now from <a href="/cms-stars-update-changes-coming-in-measurement-year-2021/">recent Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) announcements</a>, and where Stars programs go from here.</p><p>The increased weight and importance of member experience measures was a particularly hot topic. CMS has been increasing the relative weight of experience-related measures from 1.5 to 2, and beginning with 2023 Star Ratings (measurement year 2021), the <a href="https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/innovation/medicare-advantage-star-rating-calculations-change-act-now-change-2023-perceptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weight of those measures will increase to 4</a>.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, participants spent time sharing ideas for what health plans can control right now to impact 2022 ratings. With so much up in the air for the Stars program, the group felt it was imperative to have a list of actions that can make a positive difference, regardless of upcoming CMS decisions. We&rsquo;ve gathered nine of those ideas here.</p>						
				
				
				
							<h4><strong>What to focus on now: Nine r</strong><strong>oadmap considerations to impact future Star Ratings</strong></h4><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>#1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Check on your members.</strong></p><p>Medicare Advantage members need and want to hear from their plans during this tumultuous time, according to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi0mZPTiO7qAhWLXc0KHQGDDQ8QFjAGegQICxAH&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdpower.com%2Fbusiness%2Fpress-releases%2F2020-us-commercial-member-health-plan-study&amp;usg=AOvVaw2aZ4qux_2Qe6nyJJMRQVFc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several recent studies</a>. That&rsquo;s why the value of reaching out to your members can&rsquo;t be overstated. One-on-one live phone calls, or at a minimum interactive voice response (IVR) or text messaging, can help members feel connected and cared for by their plan.</p><p>Resist the urge to combine this engagement with other plan information needs, though. The outreach shouldn&rsquo;t include a call to action of any kind for the member&mdash;the goal should be a helpful check-in only&mdash;one that assists them with any needs or questions they may have. Here&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<a href="/one-on-one-check-ins-are-engagement-lifesavers-for-seniors-during-the-pandemic/">quick case study</a>&nbsp;of a Carenet Health COVID-19 check-in program for inspiration.</p><p><strong>#2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Take care of your employees.</strong></p><p>Your customer service and care management teams in particular are likely taking calls they&rsquo;ve never encountered before, thanks to COVID-19. They&rsquo;re fielding calls about everything from where to find hand sanitizer and masks, to what antibody test results mean, to how to get tested for free, to the need for a pulse oximeter at home.</p><p>Be sure you&rsquo;re equipping your teams to answer those questions and supporting them during this stressful period. Many are working from home for the first time, which means they may need different types of support than they have in the past, too. Well-trained and supported employees make the best representatives of your plan to consumers.</p><p><strong>#3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Stay close to your providers.</strong></p><p>Provider engagement is always essential. After all, a majority of a plan&rsquo;s Star Ratings can be linked to what happens or doesn&rsquo;t happen between patients and providers. With unprecedented practice closures and reduced hours, it&rsquo;s even more critical to reach out to your provider network to find out if they&rsquo;re open, how and when they&rsquo;re accepting patients, and what support your plan can provide.</p><p>Telephonic outreach is a good tool for this and can go a long way toward improving provider-plan trust.</p><p><strong>#4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Leverage telehealth and educate members&nbsp;and others on how to get the most from it.</strong></p><p><a href="/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">Telehealth</a>&nbsp;has been plunged into mainstream healthcare now, out of necessity. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean everyone knows how to use it&mdash;and that includes not only your members, but your provider network and internal teams.</p><p>Consider developing tools to help different audiences understand the benefits of telehealth. Support its continued adoption with instructional videos, positive testimonials, quick information on how to prepare in advance&mdash;anything that can prepare individuals for accessing and getting what they need from virtual care.</p><p>There is mixed data on the&nbsp;<a href="/young-adults-using-telehealth-more-older-and-lower-income-americans-slower-to-adopt-covid-19-report/">Medicare population&rsquo;s use of telehealth</a>&nbsp;during the pandemic, so developing keys to success will be necessary for your plan.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/technology-divide-between-senior-haves-and-have-nots-roils-pandemic-response" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One study</a>&nbsp;found that only about 25% of senior patients had appropriate technology and knew how to use it.</p><p><strong>#5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Utilize non-invasive in-home testing to close select HEDIS</strong><sup>&reg;&nbsp;</sup><strong>gaps.</strong></p><p>Closing care gaps has been made more difficult by the pandemic and the resulting anxiety over potential in-office exposure and access to routine screenings. Many health plans are wisely working with in-home lab vendors to proactively offer easy-to-use kits for preventive care like fit tests, diabetic testing, colon cancer screening and chronic kidney disease testing.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve been thinking of implementing these types of programs, use these next few months to see what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. We already know, however, that success requires&nbsp;<a href="/strategic-engagement-solution-medicare-hedis-gap-closure-success-story/">strategic communication</a>&nbsp;with members before and after their testing.</p><p><strong>#6 &nbsp; &nbsp;Prioritize actions related to diabetes measures.</strong></p><p>Diabetic and pre-diabetic patient outreach is a valuable area to emphasize in today&rsquo;s environment, as it&rsquo;s likely your members have been postponing in-person care, regular testing and overall contact with healthcare professionals since March. That void in treatment and care can have long-term effects on overall health.</p><p>Comprehensive engagement of these members should go beyond checking the at-home testing box. Consider&nbsp;<a href="/what-we-do/clinical-solutions/">tailored care management outreach</a>&nbsp;by phone, follow-up texting support and routine phone check-ins&mdash;phone calls that can be warm-transferred within your plan based on a member&rsquo;s needs. Making sure your member can receive their supplies and medications should continue to be top of mind.</p><p>Helping diabetic members use telehealth for disease control is a sensible idea, too, as is leveraging outreach to this high-risk COVID-19 population with reminders on safety.</p><p><strong>#7 &nbsp; &nbsp;Focus on behavioral health.</strong></p><p>The mental health of your members affects so much&mdash;including their physical health, quality of life, satisfaction with your services, HOS scores and more. And it&rsquo;s no secret that depression, anxiety and loneliness have been increasing in seniors since the pandemic began.</p><p>Now is the right time to improve your plan&rsquo;s engagement with members about their mental health. Make sure they know about the resources you offer, especially any&nbsp;<a href="/tag/behavioral-health/">behavioral health-specific crisis support</a>, your&nbsp;<a href="/delivering-a-personal-and-meaningful-telehealth-experience-takes-skill-guided-by-these-7-steps/">24/7 nurse triage line</a>&nbsp;and virtual counseling. Make them aware of the costs, if any, to use these benefits and educate them about the self-help tools available, as well.</p><p><strong>#8 &nbsp; &nbsp;Enhance your transitional care management.</strong></p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncqa.org/hedis/measures/plan-all-cause-readmissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plan All-Cause Readmissions measure</a>&nbsp;is returning, and there are two new transitional care measures on the horizon. Remember, transitional care coordination requires substantial energy and focus on the part of a health plan and its partners. So put in the work now to fully integrate processes, enhance your performance and improve member satisfaction.</p><p><strong>#9 &nbsp; &nbsp;Develop member sentiment reporting.</strong></p><p>One of the most essential initiatives discussed at the virtual collaboration event was developing a plan to gather, report and act on member sentiment. With patient experience measures increasing in weight in the Stars program, and net promoter score (NPS) a future Stars measure, plans need to fully understand member sentiment as soon as possible. Frequent satisfaction and NPS surveys are recommended, as is socializing the findings internally.</p><p>Another vital factor in member sentiment studies is being able to correlate the findings to specific provider groups and geographic areas&mdash;so that you can identify where your best opportunities lie in improving member satisfaction and experience.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to discuss any of these ideas in more depth, please reach out to Rex at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rex.wallace@rexwallaceconsulting.com">rex.wallace@rexwallaceconsulting.com</a>&nbsp;or contact our&nbsp;<a href="/contact/">Carenet Health experts</a>.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>Watch for more content on the CMS Star Ratings program for Medicare Advantage plans coming soon from&nbsp;<a href="/">Carenet Health</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rexwallaceconsulting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rex Wallace Consulting</a>.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to be considered as an applicant for future Mapping the Stars workshops,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:marketing@carenethealthcare.com">please contact us</a>&nbsp;with a quick note.</p><p>HEDIS<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;is a registered trademark of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA).</p>

							<p>If your health plan is considering adding a <a href="/what-we-do/advocacy-solutions/">health advocate service</a> (also called health advocacy, healthcare navigation or health plan concierge services) as a benefit for members, you may want to know the types of questions that can be answered by the typical advocacy program specialist.</p><blockquote><p>First, a definition of a health advocacy service: <a href="/what-we-do/advocacy-solutions/">High-touch, concierge-level</a> support for individuals (plan members, employees) that helps and empowers them to easily navigate the complex healthcare system, access the right care, make informed decisions and spend the healthcare dollars wisely. A health advocate serves as a guide and problem-solver who is there to hold a member&rsquo;s hand throughout the healthcare journey. Changing and more complicated <a href="https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/types-of-health-insurance-plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare delivery models</a> and the <a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/health-plans-have-consumer-engagement-problem-jd-powers-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">need for an improved member experience</a> have led many health plans to offer this kind of advocacy solution.</p></blockquote><p><a href="/defining_different_types_of_healthcare_concierge_services/">Advocacy services</a> are usually reachable via a toll-free number given out by the health plan or employer. An advocate is assigned to an individual and will continue working with that person until the issue is resolved. An advocate&rsquo;s goal will then be to provide information and resolve issues, whether it has to do with a medical billing error, denied claim, benefits choices, health savings account rules or how to get a specialist referral.</p><p>Here are a few examples of questions that health advocates can answer:</p><ul><li>Which benefits plan makes the most sense for my family?</li><li>How much have I spent toward my deductible?</li><li>Will my plan cover the new drug my provider prescribed?</li><li>What do I need to do to get approved for surgery?</li><li>What happens if I don&rsquo;t use all funds in my HSA or FSA?</li><li>How do I get a specialist referral, appointment and records transfer?</li><li>What do I do if my claim is denied?</li><li>How do I determine if this surprise medical bill is legitimate?</li><li>Can I get help with transportation to and from my outpatient surgery?</li><li>Will my insurance cover getting a second opinion?</li><li>Who is the best doctor in my area for treating my condition?</li><li>Will this lab work my physician ordered be covered?</li><li>How do I transfer my x-rays to another provider?</li><li>Can you help me arrange post-discharge home care?</li><li>Who can help me find assisted living care for my parent?</li><li>Who can explain this explanation of benefits I received?</li><li>Can you help me find clinical trials?</li><li>How can I save money on prescriptions?</li><li>What is my copay for this treatment?</li><li>What do I need to do to transition to Medicare?</li></ul><p>You can find additional information on the value and content of these types of health advocacy programs in our ebook,&nbsp;<a href="/why-joining-the-concierge-movement-is-critical-for-meeting-employer-needs-and-consumer-expectations/"><em>Why Joining the Concierge Movement Is Critical for Meeting Employer Need</em><em>s and Consumer Expectations</em><em>.</em></a></p>

							<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard the industry buzz around <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/2020/06/11/the-new-normal-rethinking-healthcare-delivery-in-a-post-covid-world/#.Xxcfxy2ZOt8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare&rsquo;s &ldquo;new normal.&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;But in reality, a new normal doesn&rsquo;t exist yet.</p><p>The pandemic continues to be anything but predictable. Community, regional and statewide outbreaks are in the news. Forecasting models depend on human behavior and the hoped-for success of public health initiatives. Patients&rsquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2020/04/29/support-covid-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post-discharge needs</a>&nbsp;are evolving, and there is a growing list of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2020/06/02/covid-health-effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-term health effects</a>&nbsp;that may drive continuing care management.&nbsp;<strong><em>And what happens when flu season hits, too?</em></strong></p><p>All of this can leave health plans and other healthcare organizations preparing for fluctuating member engagement needs without a lot of confidence. Building out in-house staff readiness could be a significant waste of time and money if it ends up not being necessary.</p><p><strong>Learning to share: The value of pooled engagement resources&nbsp;</strong></p><p>One solution for payers and providers is the use of an available, shared pool of non-clinical and clinical resources&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s engagement specialists, member services professionals, registered nurses, care coordinators or health advocates&mdash;that can be tapped when demand increases.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a flexible concept that means you typically pay for only what you need. Deploying&nbsp;<a href="/unprecedented-times-call-for-extraordinary-partnership/">just-in-time extra capacity</a>&nbsp;via a shared pool allows you to adapt in real time to shifts in needs, and expensive dedicated teams don&rsquo;t sit idle, waiting. Plus, a pool of shared professionals means you don&rsquo;t have to support independent contractors or build a long-standing in-house team and support it over the long-term. (Shared services typically do require upfront contracts to secure your resources.)</p><p><strong>Leveraging shared services, of course, is not a new concept. But it&rsquo;s one that deserves a fresh look when current staffing is already near its limits.</strong></p>

							<p><strong style="color: #d31c5b; font-size: x-large;">Benefits of diving into the shared pool&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A shared resource model works especially well when a trifecta of factors are in play: &nbsp;forecasting of demand and timing is difficult, you need to move quickly as needs change, and a cost-effective solution with low initial outlay is important.</p><p>Other key benefits can include:</p><ul><li><strong>Exceeding consumer expectations 24/7. </strong>Members and patients in a crisis like a pandemic need help and answers, and they need them at 2 p.m. AND 2 a.m. Flexible, on-demand shared resources can deliver that around-the-clock service easier and more cost-effectively than one dedicated team with limited numbers of available hours. The importance of this benefit can&rsquo;t be overstated in today&rsquo;s world: A <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2020-us-commercial-member-health-plan-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J.D. Power study</a> found that U.S. health plan members haven&rsquo;t felt supported by their insurers during the crisis. Sixty (60) percent said they weren&rsquo;t contacted by their health plan with guidance or information related to COVID-19.</li><li><strong>Responding rapidly to emergent demands.</strong> A collective pool of resources is the epitome of flexibility. Availability of resources can be turned off and on with fluctuating requirements. (<a href="/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">Geographic diversity in the talent pool</a> is important here due to pandemic regional outbreaks.)</li><li><strong>Leveraging outside expertise.</strong> You may not have all of the in-house expertise, in the number of professionals needed, to meet engagement and telehealth demand in a crisis. A specialized healthcare shared service provider will. For instance, you may need member services professionals that also have in-clinic experience. Or you may need <a href="/the-emerging-role-of-health-plans-in-behavioral-health-crisis-services/">licensed behavioral health support</a> that&rsquo;s not available in your core skillsets.</li><li><strong>Enjoying industry-wide insights. </strong>Tapping into a provider of shared resources means you get insights on best practices from across the spectrum. This can leave your organization better prepared and informed. Testing of scripts and other engagement factors will also benefit all in the shared resources group.</li><li><strong>Freeing up your in-house teams.</strong> Because they aren&rsquo;t frantically trying to handle sizable increases in member needs and calls, your professionals can focus their attention on fixed, not variable, needs.</li></ul><p><span style="color: #d31c5b; font-size: x-large;"><strong>Considerations when using shared engagement resources</strong></span></p><p>Utilizing shared resource groups can have shortcomings that should also be considered. Addressing these upfront with your engagement and telehealth providers will be essential for success.</p><ul><li><strong>Lack of special organizational knowledge in external teams</strong>. Organizations have distinct policies and cultures. A seamless consumer experience requires that the shared talent be trained in the specifics of the organizations using the resources. Staff should also be empowered to handle member needs and problem-solve without additional client intervention when possible.</li><li><strong>Quality monitoring and reporting</strong>. Even in a crisis, continuous quality monitoring and performance improvement should be a priority. Your metrics may be different than an external pool; you&rsquo;ll need to address that and find solutions for reporting and evaluation, so you can ensure your members are getting the service they deserve.</li><li><strong>Technology integration.</strong> You will need time to connect your systems to those of the shared resources provider for a smooth consumer experience at launch. You may need devoted IT support on your end, at least for a little while, to make <a href="/about/technology/">interoperability</a> happen in a timely manner.</li></ul><p><span style="color: #d31c5b;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">Ideas&nbsp;for ways to use shared engagement&nbsp;and telehealth resources</span></strong><strong style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p>Many organizations think of using shared engagement resources for obvious needs such as customer service overflow or after-hours support. We&rsquo;ve gathered some additional ideas for inspiration&mdash;ways you can use your portion of a talent pool to continue to increase care access and support for your members and patients:</p><ul><li>Nurse triage of member/patient calls for appropriate care direction (vital for symptomatic coronavirus patients)</li><li>Telemedicine portal sign-ups and appointment setting</li><li>COVID-19 testing results support and outreach</li><li>Crisis or maintenance support for growing mental health needs</li><li>Chronic disease engagement and care management</li><li>Well-being check-ins (<a href="/one-on-one-check-ins-are-engagement-lifesavers-for-seniors-during-the-pandemic/">especially good for seniors</a>)</li><li>High-risk guidance and outreach (particularly COVID-19 related)</li><li><a href="/when-crisis-demands-innovation-remote-patient-monitoring-boosts-inpatient-capacity-and-helps-covid-19-patients-avoid-readmissions/">Remote patient monitoring</a> clinical support</li><li>Support for COVID-19 at-home cases or after inpatient discharge</li><li>Benefits navigation help for pandemic-impacted patients</li><li>Virtual clinical support needs (important as employers implement return-to-work plans and employees need guidance)</li><li>Transportation/in-person visit coordination for preventive care</li><li>Medication refills and other treatment adherence support</li><li>Closing gaps for proactive care, like mammograms and other cancer testing</li></ul><p><span style="color: #d31c5b; font-size: x-large;"><strong>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be an either/or choice</strong></span></p><p>Carenet Health offers a variety of engagement, telehealth, clinical support and advocacy delivery models, and we&rsquo;ve found that no model is perfect in every situation. In fact, it often takes a combination of models to provide the levels of service today&rsquo;s healthcare consumers need.</p><p>But with no crystal ball in sight, we&rsquo;re encouraging health plans, health systems and provider-clinic networks to <a href="/contact/">talk to us soon</a> if you&rsquo;re considering leveraging our limited amount of shared talent resources, or if you&rsquo;d like to discuss setting up a <a href="/what-we-do/">dedicated clinical or non-clinical resource team</a>.</p><p><strong style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="color: #e23b56;">___________</span></strong></p><p>Learn more about our <a href="/unprecedented-times-call-for-extraordinary-partnership/">COVID-19 Shared Resources Support Center</a>.</p>

							<p>SAN ANTONIO, Texas, July 15, 2020 &ndash; <a href="/">Carenet Health</a>, one of the nation&rsquo;s largest providers of 24/7 telehealth and healthcare engagement solutions, and Oregon-based <a href="https://protocallservices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProtoCall Services</a>, the leading contact center for specialty behavioral health services, have joined forces to offer a crisis support line model that triages both physical and mental health needs from a single point of contact.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</a>, at least one in five adults experiences mental illness each year; the statistic is one in six for ages 6-17. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the problem, with studies finding at least half of all American adults report the crisis is harming their psychological wellbeing. Meanwhile, Medicaid and Medicare managed care plans and commercial health plans alike have been seeking ways to improve behavioral health crisis support.</p><p><a href="/about/meet-the-team/">Vikie Spulak</a>, Chief Client Officer at Carenet, said there has been immediate demand for the offering&mdash; which is a natural extension of Carenet&rsquo;s 24-hour virtual care model.</p><p>&ldquo;With our nurse triage center as the cornerstone of our <a href="/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">telehealth offerings</a>, we see ourselves as an on-demand front door for healthcare consumers to access a multitude of care types and specialties,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A patient shouldn&rsquo;t have to contact two or three different support lines to receive the level of support they need.&rdquo;</p><p>The combined Carenet Health-ProtoCall crisis support model allows their health plan and health system clients to provide one dedicated contact number for medical symptoms or <a href="/the-emerging-role-of-health-plans-in-behavioral-health-crisis-services/">behavioral health issues</a>. Upon initial triage, those determined to be facing a behavioral health crisis are routed to ProtoCall&rsquo;s licensed behavioral health clinicians who assess the crisis, coordinate activities needed to de-escalate situations and connect patients to resources for longer-term solutions.</p><p>If individuals are experiencing physical medical-related symptoms or have non-emergency medical questions, they are placed in a typical nurse advice/triage workflow for assistance. Many clients also choose to include direct access to virtual physician e-consults, as well.</p><p>&ldquo;This model delivers a number of benefits &hellip; cost-effective resource management, a seamless patient experience, appropriate utilization of specialty services and the highest-quality care,&rdquo; Spulak said. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without ProtoCall&rsquo;s more than 25 years of experience in telephonic crisis assessment, intervention and stabilization services.&rdquo;</p><p>ProtoCall CEO Phil Evans noted the two companies share a strong dedication to providing 24-hour access to meaningful, evidence-based care. &ldquo;At ProtoCall, we&rsquo;ve long been committed to closing the gap between personalized behavioral health care and immediate, on-demand access when and where it&rsquo;s needed. With the evolving pandemic, that&rsquo;s becoming an even more urgent requirement, and our partnership with Carenet is another important step forward not just for us, but for the industry.&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align: center;">###</p><p><strong>About Carenet Health:&nbsp;</strong>Carenet Health is one of the healthcare industry&rsquo;s leading consumer engagement and telehealth partners&mdash;providing member and patient engagement, clinical support, virtual care and advocacy solutions on behalf of 250+ of the nation&rsquo;s premier health plans, providers, health systems and Fortune 500 companies.

							<p>By March 2020, the warning signs were evident, sending shockwaves through the U.S. healthcare system. If the novel coronavirus pandemic continued on its predicted path, American hospitals <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/channels/health-forum/fullarticle/2763353" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would need more inpatient beds</a> than currently available. A lot more. And quickly.</p><p>In New York alone, the governor estimated the state would need <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/ny-will-need-more-than-100000-hospital-beds-when-infections-peak-cuomo/2330868/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">110,000 more beds</a> to meet demand. That announcement was made after the number of New York COVID-19 cases <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/nyc-mayor-eyes-sf-shelter-in-place-model-as-tri-state-cases-near-3500-27-dead/2333955/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rose 50% in one day</a>. Solutions ranged from building temporary tent hospitals to converting churches into intensive care units.</p><p>Meanwhile, an East Coast-area hospital was preparing for its own anticipated volume and capacity challenges. That&rsquo;s when <a href="https://www.cchpca.org/about/about-telehealth/remote-patient-monitoring-rpm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remote patient monitoring (RPM)</a> emerged as an idea that could be implemented at the hospital for an immediate impact in a short timeframe.</p><p><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #e23b56;"><strong>Inventive thinking with a long list of benefits</strong></span></p><p>Clinical leaders believed a tech-enabled, nurse-supported remote health monitoring program could be used to help discharge still-symptomatic COVID-19 patients sooner and safely, reducing their lengths of stay. It could also play an important role in preventing hospital readmissions during patients&rsquo; recovery.</p><p>If the program worked, both factors could free up inpatient resource capacity.</p><p>In addition, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12652-017-0598-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies had previously shown</a> RPM initiatives could improve not only treatment adherence and access to ongoing care, but also patient satisfaction and healthcare costs.</p><p>The concept couldn&rsquo;t solve all of the capacity challenges, but it would be a low-risk, high-reward effort in a time when out-of-the-box thinking was crucial.</p><p><strong style="color: #e23b56; font-size: x-large;">Health monitoring technology + one-on-one human outreach</strong></p><p>As the development of the hospital&rsquo;s COVID-19 RPM program began, <a href="/">Carenet Health</a> was enlisted as an external care partner to provide around-the-clock nurse-to-patient clinical support. Proven RPM technology was provided by <a href="https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/services/population-health-management/patient-engagement/remote-patient-monitoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philips</a>.</p><p>The program was made up of a 14-day post-discharge protocol designed to keep in touch with patients who had been hospitalized for virus symptoms and complications.</p><p>At time of discharge, COVID-19 patients were given kits to monitor their temperature, blood pressure and oxygen saturation while recovering at home. If a patient&rsquo;s data exceeded evidence-based parameters set by the hospital, a call to action was triggered for a Carenet telehealth registered nurse (RN) to evaluate and validate the data and contact the patient for next steps. Subsequent actions could be recommending the patient continue to self-monitor, talk with their monitoring physician, return to the emergency department or call 9-1-1 for immediate, life-saving emergency care.</p><p><span style="color: #e23b56; font-size: x-large;"><strong>Positive RPM results</strong></span></p><p>Releasing patients into a remote monitoring program provided an efficient way to track patient recovery and put patients in the best position to regain health stability.</p><p>While exact numbers are not available for publication, readmissions in the program were exceedingly rare. The Carenet RN team&mdash;trained to deliver <a href="/delivering-a-personal-and-meaningful-telehealth-experience-takes-skill-guided-by-these-7-steps/">personal, compassionate and knowledgeable care</a>&mdash;reported that patients said they felt well cared for, especially when experiencing recovery setbacks.

							<p>Most states and cities are relaxing pandemic-related restrictions across the U.S., but COVID-19 is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/08/who-warns-most-people-still-at-risk-of-coronavirus-infection-as-mass-gatherings-resume-worldwide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still widely circulating</a>. In some areas, cases, hospitalizations and deaths are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-trends/new-u-s-covid-19-cases-surge-25-last-week-arizona-florida-and-texas-set-records-idUSKBN23U1L7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the rise</a>. On the telehealth consumer frontlines,&nbsp;<a href="/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">Carenet Health nurse triage teams</a>&nbsp;are seeing upward trends again in both overall telehealth case volume and COVID-19-related case numbers.</p><p>Despite those worrisome statistics, Americans are eager to return to some semblance of pre-pandemic life. But what&rsquo;s the safest way to do that?</p><p>We asked our telehealth registered nurses (RNs)&mdash;<a href="/who-we-serve/">who serve thousands of individuals and triage thousands of cases across the nation each day</a>&mdash;what their advice is for health plans, based on the members they&rsquo;re connecting with right now.</p><p><strong>&gt; Don&rsquo;t stop communicating what we know works to prevent infection.</strong></p><p>Our nurses are urging health plans to keep up the safety reminders to their members&mdash;encouraging coverings over the nose and mouth when around other people and the practice of social distancing of at least 6 feet. They&rsquo;re also encouraging plans to make sure members know that many people infected with COVID-19 are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/09/health/asymptomatic-presymptomatic-coronavirus-spread-explained-wellness/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actively shedding the virus</a>&nbsp;and showing no symptoms.</p><p>&ldquo;Stories are helpful in explaining this. Like &hellip; your aunt may look perfectly healthy at a family barbecue, but she may be COVID-19 positive and exposing everyone without knowing it,&rdquo; one nurse said.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We need to tell members to consider the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same guidelines</a>&nbsp;we&rsquo;ve been talking about for several months now&mdash;wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, keep your distance, avoid crowds, disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces daily. That&rsquo;s how you minimize your chances of exposure, and it bears repeating again and again.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><strong>&gt; Do all you can to make sure members don&rsquo;t let their guard down.</strong><br>Carenet RNs worry that many Americans have pandemic fatigue. &ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s human nature to want to get out there again. But we&rsquo;re still very much in a pandemic. I am constantly counselling people to be cautious, especially if you are at a high risk for COVID-19 complications.&rdquo;</p><p>A Carenet colleague agreed. &ldquo;My advice is always to follow whatever you feel comfortable with within the guidelines being presented, depending on your level of health. For example, if you have diabetes, asthma, a compromised immune system &hellip; if you&rsquo;re a caregiver for the elderly, you do not want to take unnecessary chances of exposure right now.&rdquo;</p><p>One nurse had similar comments: &ldquo;I want people to understand that just because states are opening, the coronavirus is still prevalent, and it is essential that you avoid close contact with others. Yes, enjoy life, but be smart.&rdquo;</p><p>Multichannel member communications, personalized to address a specific risk, can be helpful in getting these messages across, especially among select demographic groups.</p><p>Some patients&mdash;especially young adults&mdash;seem a little unconvinced that, for example, riding in a car together makes it impossible to keep necessary distances, several nurses said. &ldquo;I think there is a bit of a false sense of security out there, and many people are not thinking about some of the simple things that need to be considered still,&rdquo; one RN said. &ldquo;For instance, after a retail or restaurant transaction, you need to wash your hands before you do anything else. Let&rsquo;s keep that top of mind.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>&gt; Direct your members to reliable sources of information.</strong></p><p>Social media and Google searches aren&rsquo;t the best ways to keep up-to-date on just how widespread the virus is in your area or what experts recommend you do to protect yourself right now. Yet nurses continually hear from patients who have turned to those sources first.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had to remind individuals to visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC website</a>, or check with their local county&rsquo;s health department,&rdquo; one RN said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shocked at how many patients have never been to the CDC site.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>The good news is that health plans can play a role in getting the factual, evidence-based information out to members on a regular basis to balance what&rsquo;s being shared that may be anecdotal or untrue.</p><p><strong>&gt; Promote the u</strong><strong>se of telehealth to minimize exposure and get information quickly&mdash;but don&rsquo;t forget about in-person care.</strong></p><p>Telehealth has seen a surge in utilization during the crisis, and it continues to be a vital part of healthcare&rsquo;s new normal. But sometimes, in-person care is absolutely needed.</p><p>One of the issues that emerged during the first months of the pandemic was that telehealth patients who truly needed emergency or urgent care often&nbsp;<a href="/telehealth-rns-reveal-how-different-age-groups-are-responding-covid-19-insights/">refused to go</a>, due to fears of COVID-19 exposure. Our teams say that hesitance appears to be enduring across most demographics.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;It remains difficult to encourage people to go to the emergency department (ED) or urgent care center. Yet three sentences before in our triage conversation, they told me they were having chest pains,&rdquo; a Carenet RN said. A colleague said she also has to remind patients that sitting in an ED doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean heightened exposure. &ldquo;You can wear a facial covering while you&rsquo;re there. And hospitals have very strict cleaning procedures. It&rsquo;s probably safer to go to the ED right now than any number of other public places, like a grocery store.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Keep talking about mental health&mdash;and how to access care and support.</strong></p><p>U.S. citizens have been reporting rising levels of emotional stress during the pandemic. A recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kff.org/report-section/kff-health-tracking-poll-late-april-2020-economic-and-mental-health-impacts-of-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaiser Family Foundation poll</a>&nbsp;found that 56% of Americans reported that worry or stress related to COVID-19 has led to at least one negative mental health effect, such as trouble with eating or sleeping, drinking more alcohol, frequent headaches, and more. And some experts think this is just the beginning of the crisis&rsquo;s psychological repercussions.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why our triage nurses have been trained to&nbsp;<a href="/delivering-a-personal-and-meaningful-telehealth-experience-takes-skill-guided-by-these-7-steps/">make personal connections with patients</a>, be aware of potential mental health issues and help guide individuals to sources of help as needed. And it&rsquo;s why health plans should consider ramping up communications about mental health issues and resources for their members.</p><p>&ldquo;Patients with anxiety and depression symptoms are still very much a part of my daily caseload,&rdquo; said one Carenet RN. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s critical that patients know where to turn to for help. They can always start with their health plan&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="/nurse-advice-line-delivers-satisfaction-and-roi/">nurse advice line</a>.&rdquo;</p><p>You can learn more about how health plans are playing a larger role in behavioral health support with dedicated crisis lines&nbsp;<a href="/the-emerging-role-of-health-plans-in-behavioral-health-crisis-services/">here</a>. We&rsquo;ve also covered the&nbsp;<a href="/mental-health-telehealth-and-what-the-pandemic-data-is-telling-us/">mental health-telehealth connection</a>&nbsp;during the pandemic here.</p><p><strong>___________</strong></p><p><strong>Wondering what&rsquo;s next for telehealth?</strong>&nbsp;You may be interested in our&nbsp;<a href="/whats-next-for-telehealth-market-forces-and-8-action-steps-you-need-to-know/">telehealth ebook</a>.

							<p>Over the past several years, many commercial health plans had begun to focus more on becoming truly consumer-centric. The pandemic, however, exposed significant cracks in those foundational efforts.</p><p>Consider just a few findings in a recent J.D. Power study:&nbsp;<strong>48% of privately insured plan members said their health plan hasn&rsquo;t shown concern for their health since the pandemic began</strong>. And 75% said they didn&rsquo;t view their health plan as a trusted partner in their health.</p><p>At Carenet Health, we work with more than 100 of the leading U.S. health plans. What we&rsquo;re seeing from that work indicates that right now is a critical time for plans to honestly explore and improve their relationships with members.</p><p>In fact, this has the potential to be a groundbreaking, transformational moment, if health plans take the right next steps.</p><p>In our ebook,&nbsp;<strong><em>The COVID-19 Pandemic as a Wake-up Call: How Health Plans Can Seize the Moment to Transform Member Relationships</em></strong>, we outline eight ways your plan can support a comprehensive consumer-centric transformation &hellip; when members need it most.</p><p>Download available now!</p>

							<p>Nurse triage companies like&nbsp;<a href="/what-we-do/">Carenet Health</a> offer symptom assessment and care information from registered nurses (RNs) for a wide range of callers with health concerns, from parents of distressed newborns to&nbsp;<a href="/the-4-es-health-plans-need-to-know-to-improve-medication-adherence/">seniors who have questions about their medications</a>.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">best telehealth solutions</a>&nbsp;tailor their nurse advice approach to each individual&rsquo;s needs and foster a human connection. This type of personalized experience not only helps quell patient anxiety, but also serves to keep patients and health plan members coming back. And that&rsquo;s a positive driver for modern, on-demand, 24/7 care access and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/clinical-care/cost-savings-telemedicine-estimated-19-120-patient-visit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost-savings it can deliver</a>.</p><p>At&nbsp;Carenet, our nurse triage team speaks with thousands of patients every day on behalf of&nbsp;<a href="/who-we-serve/">hundreds of health plans and healthcare providers</a>. Obviously, in telehealth, some of the tools used to put patients at ease during in-person care interactions simply aren&rsquo;t an option. So how do Carenet&rsquo;s telephonic-based triage nurses make each interaction personal, compassionate and meaningful&mdash;so much so that their industry-leading patient satisfaction ratings consistently range from 95% to 100%?</p><p>Our clinical teams will tell you it&rsquo;s all in the&nbsp;<a href="/careers/carenet-culture/">culture, training and support</a>&nbsp;provided to our nurses. To get a deeper look, we went straight to the source and asked our telehealth RNs to share some of the ways they&rsquo;re making interactions more intimate, impactful and effective&mdash;even as case volume has increased during a global pandemic.</p>						
				
				
				
							<p><i class="far fa-heart fa-3x fa-border" style="float: left; margin-right: 7px; color: #dc1c5b; border-color: white;"></i><strong>1. Thinking compassion&mdash;and making sure it&rsquo;s conveyed in tone of voice.</strong> A nurse&rsquo;s warm, welcoming tone on the other end of the line can instantly calm a worried caller&mdash;and patients are comforted when immediately met with compassion. Speech that sounds kind, caring, respectful and professional is critical. Also important is appropriate volume, inflection and speed based on each patient&rsquo;s vocal demeanor.</p><p>As explained by one Carenet nurse: &ldquo;If someone is very anxious or emotional, I try to be very soft in my response. Interjecting words of empathy and phrases of understanding and confirmation can show someone that you&rsquo;re listening and really trying to see where they&rsquo;re coming from.&rdquo;</p><p>Another team member added, &ldquo;I try to put myself in their shoes or think of them as my family member. Patients can sense that in your tone of voice and by the word choices you make.&rdquo;</p>						
				
				
				
							<p><i class="far fa-smile fa-3x fa-border" style="float: left; margin-right: 7px; color: #dc1c5b; border-color: white;"></i><strong>2. Smiling, even when no one can see it.</strong> &ldquo;Wearing&rdquo; a smile throughout a nurse triage call and, as one nurse puts it, &ldquo;letting that smile spread into our speech,&rdquo; can make a difference in how the caller receives a nurse&rsquo;s recommendations. Smiling can also help the RN&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/micahsolomon/2020/05/15/face-to-face-and-in-telemedicine-patient-experience-depends-on-nailing-these-7-hospitality-elements/#68d4ae288fd9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adopt a hospitality mindset</a>&nbsp;during telehealth connections.</p><p>One of our nurses described it this way: &ldquo;I try to make patients feel comfortable with me and take a quick moment to interject a little humor if at all possible or appropriate, or find a way to break the ice, so they can feel comfortable opening up more.&rdquo;</p>						
				
				
				
							<p><i class="far fa-check-circle fa-3x fa-border" style="float: left; margin-right: 7px; color: #dc1c5b; border-color: white;"></i><strong>3. Acknowledging and validating important feelings.</strong> Truly listening to their concerns and responding to what they&rsquo;re feeling can go a long way in easing callers&rsquo; stress and frustration. This was especially important&nbsp;<a href="/addressing-the-void-telehealth-steps-up-for-chronic-disease-patients/">during the COVID-19 crisis</a>, when patients had difficulty reaching their primary care providers.</p><p>&ldquo;I try to work in empathetic statements, so they know I care about their personal situation, like &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry to hear that,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re feeling a little better today,&rsquo;&rdquo; a Carenet nurse said. &ldquo;I let them talk, tell them I understand and remind them we are just a phone call away&hellip; this lets them know they are never alone.&rdquo;</p><p>Another Carenet colleague agreed, opting for statements that validate callers&rsquo; fear or frustration&mdash;for example: &ldquo;That pain sounds pretty strong. I can understand your frustration and see you&rsquo;ve been dealing with it on your own for quite a while,&rdquo; or &ldquo;No wonder you called. If my heart was feeling like that, I&rsquo;d call, too.&rdquo;</p>						
				
				
				
							<p><i class="far fa-user fa-3x fa-border" style="float: left; margin-right: 7px; color: #dc1c5b; border-color: white;"></i><strong>4. Adding a personal touch.&nbsp;</strong>Building rapport during the brief time together is also important for bonding, establishing trust and conveying to the caller their importance and the nursing professional&rsquo;s concern for their needs, advises one Carenet RN.</p><p>&ldquo;Instead of just going through each symptom assessment question, I make sure to address their specific concerns and answer their specific questions,&rdquo;&nbsp;she says. &ldquo;The goal is to make sure the patient feels connected and open to sharing their feelings, which will in turn make them more willing to follow your advice and be&nbsp;thankful they reached out for help.&rdquo; She adds, &ldquo;If I have an anecdote that pertains, I share it.&rdquo;</p><p>Another Carenet RN says that doing a quick review of each caller&rsquo;s personal record and any history of previous calls demonstrates that the telehealth team knows and understands them.</p>						
				
				
				
							<p><i class="fas fa-flag-checkered fa-3x fa-border" style="float: left; margin-right: 7px; color: #dc1c5b; border-color: white;"></i><strong>5. Remembering that slow and steady wins the race.</strong> Taking the time to really learn about the patient&rsquo;s health concern at hand helps ease caller fears and concerns. One Carenet nurse uses guidance and patience as the foundation of her calls.</p><p>&ldquo;I try to repeat back some of the important things the caller says, so they know that I&rsquo;ve heard them, and I never rush even if we are in a time crunch,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about treating each caller like they are the only person in the world in that moment.&rdquo;</p><p>Another Carenet RN uses personal memories and visualization to make the experience meaningful:&nbsp;&ldquo;I picture the time my grandmother was in pain and no one would listen, or picture my grandpa getting lab results with no one to explain what they mean. I think, &lsquo;How can I change this person&rsquo;s perception about healthcare by listening and being attentive?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>						
				
				
				
							<p><i class="fas fa-award fa-3x fa-border" style="float: left; margin-right: 7px; color: #dc1c5b; border-color: white;"></i><strong>6. Leveraging the power of education.&nbsp;</strong>Carefully explaining things can help an RN build an instant relationship with the patient. When callers are offered valuable information after symptoms have been assessed, they tend to respond better and feel more at ease&mdash;an approach that has proven very helpful in reassuring callers who are worried about COVID-19.</p><p>&ldquo;If some form of summarized information is given on an urgent issue, I find patients are more likely to comply,&rdquo; says a longtime Carenet nurse. &ldquo;For non-urgent symptoms, offering specific examples of symptoms to watch for that would make the situation urgent seems to help enhance the interaction.&rdquo;</p><p>A Carenet colleague adds, &ldquo;If&nbsp;you teach your patient one thing with each call that helps&nbsp;them&mdash;and they feel like you were easy to talk to&mdash;they will call again.&rdquo;</p>						
				
				
				
							<p><i class="fas fa-road fa-3x fa-border" style="float: left; margin-right: 7px; color: #dc1c5b; border-color: white;"></i><strong>7</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Going the extra mile and saying &ldquo;thanks.&rdquo;</strong> Adding value with extra effort is key, says one Carenet nurse. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to remember that we can help find hope for the patient&mdash;such as arranging transportation to the doctor if necessary, searching for a nearby pharmacy, providing referrals or giving directions to a facility.&rdquo;</p><p>Another RN heralds the importance of letting patients know you&rsquo;re just a phone call away: &ldquo;I tell them I&rsquo;m glad they called, and add something like, &lsquo;Please call us back anytime; we&rsquo;re always here to help.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p><strong>&mdash;</strong></p><p>Carenet&rsquo;s high-performing nurse advice line and triage center is staffed by RNs with an average of 15 years of clinical experience who consistently apply&nbsp;<a href="/ten-nurse-advice-line-best-practices/">telehealth best practices</a>.&nbsp;<a href="/contact/">Contact Carenet Health</a>&nbsp;to talk to us about optimizing your telehealth solutions.</p>

							<p>SAN ANTONIO, Texas, June 10, 2020 &ndash; San Antonio-based Carenet Health, a leading provider of healthcare engagement and 24/7 telehealth solutions, has received notice that its nurse advice triage center has again been fully certified by the <a href="https://www.ncqa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)</a>.</p><p>The certification falls under the NCQA Health Information Products (HIP) category for a Health Information Line.

							<p>Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic began to significantly shift telehealth from a convenience to a necessity, and <a href="/what-we-do/telehealth-solutions/">on-demand virtual care</a> is playing a vital role in meeting patients&rsquo; and health plan members&rsquo; needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Yet no matter what your telehealth solution looks like right now&mdash;whether you&rsquo;ve had a system in place for a while or recently ramped up your <a href="https://www.americantelemed.org/press-releases/ata-letter-to-congress-outlines-additional-recommendations-to-advance-telehealth-to-combat-covid-19-as-part-of-the-next-coronavirus-relief-package/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telehealth to combat COVID-19</a>&mdash;patient needs and expectations, as well as your organization&rsquo;s needs and expectations, will likely continue to change quickly.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important that your virtual care approach is set up to optimize resources, provide a seamless and satisfactory patient experience, enhance ROI and keep costs low with improved efficiencies.</p><p><strong>Problem number one? Telehealth fragmentation</strong></p><p>The conventional approach to telehealth has involved a disjointed infrastructure, with elements added together as needed&mdash;much like a house that&rsquo;s been expanded and added on to as a family&rsquo;s needs change over time. A garage here, an extra bedroom there, but no comprehensive architectural plans.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not unusual for health plans, health systems and provider groups to have separate partners or solutions for a nurse advice line, physician video consultations, online behavioral health services and after-hours member support.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem is that this disparate configuration can be expensive to maintain, challenging to manage the different moving parts and confusing for healthcare consumers. It can lead to a delay in patients being directed to the most appropriate (and cost-effective) setting of care quickly.</p><p>Also, notably, having siloed telehealth solutions can mean a healthcare organization will be slow to respond to what&rsquo;s coming next, whether we&rsquo;re in the middle of a pandemic or not.</p><p>For providers especially, telehealth that&rsquo;s not optimized and consolidated can create a barrier to fully extending access to care. But a streamlined, non-siloed model can bolster reach efficiently, bringing more services and on-demand functionality to the typical pool of resources.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Solving for an optimized triaged and virtual care experience</strong></p><p>Healthcare consumers who seek out telehealth are often worried and not feeling well, and for many first-time users, they&rsquo;re uncertain about where to turn for help. They shouldn&rsquo;t have to decide whether they need a nurse advice line, a physician, a mental health specialist or another type of care.</p><p>So how can the telehealth experience better set the stage for efficient patient flow, high user satisfaction and rapid speed-to-care&mdash;all hallmarks of an optimized virtual care model? It requires streamlining the experience and fine-tuning which resources are needed at what point in the patient journey.</p><p>In a more perfect virtual care model, telehealth services are consolidated into a single point of access&mdash;a front door to a <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/FINAL_Carenet_Telehealth-Brochure.pdf">consolidated virtual clinic</a>&mdash;that lets consumers call one number or use one app or web portal entry point. From that point, they are routed to general information services, registered nurses for at-home treatment and guidance, live virtual physician consults, behavioral health assistance or whatever health service fits their needs best.</p><p>This &ldquo;telehealth command center&rdquo; type of virtual resource management is also more cost-effective. In the case of <a href="/benefits_of_a_high_performning_nurse_advice_line/">Carenet Health&rsquo;s nurse triage center</a>, roughly half of the calls coming in for a virtual physician consult are resolved first with evidence-based, highly skilled nurse triage, without the need for physician intervention. Only patients who will benefit from an M.D. consult (or mental health crisis support professional) move on in the virtual clinic process, while RNs provide guidance or care at a lower price point to those who don&rsquo;t need to move on.</p><p>With this structure, healthcare consumers get exactly the level of care and information they need, and different professional resources are directed to precisely the right need.</p><p>A bonus is that, typically, the streamlining can create around a 67% cost-savings for the payer or provider who offers a virtual clinic solution. (<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/230b3dc3-b6e5-491e-9fc5-18e41b037350.pdf">More on that here</a>.)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The path to telehealth progress</strong></p><p>As increasing adoption promises to make <a href="/telehealth-will-soon-be-as-ordinary-as-online-banking/">telehealth as common as online banking</a>, industry partners need to work together on continuous improvement. Even with the recent growth, telehealth utilization is still comparatively low, and there&rsquo;s room for improvement in everything from efficiency to patient experience.</p><p>Keeping resources deployed 24/7 and operating at peak efficiency needs to be a top priority. As the industry addresses the <a href="https://chimecentral.org/mediaposts/the-new-normal-of-healthcare-after-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next phase of a new normal</a>, we all need to think beyond the doctor-led virtual consult to define telehealth as everything from registered nurse triage to crisis mental health support to on-demand connections to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nutritionists and more.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to explore telehealth optimization with our experts, <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> today.</p>

							<p>Much of the news about COVID-19 focuses on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physical symptoms</a> patients experience when battling the virus. But the pandemic has also contributed to a rise in mental health issues as individuals struggle to cope with the combined stresses of isolation, social distancing, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273909/seasonally-adjusted-monthly-unemployment-rate-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial strains</a> and health worries.</p><p>At <a href="/what-we-do/">Carenet Health</a>, we analyzed our nurse advise line and Virtual Clinic data over a 30-day period (March 21- April 21, 2020) during the COVID-19 crisis and found an alarming <a href="/mental-health-telehealth-and-what-the-pandemic-data-is-telling-us/">increase of 166%</a> in the numbers of behavioral health triage cases handled by our healthcare professionals.</p><p>What are the main issues driving the dramatic increase in the need for virtual behavioral health support?&nbsp;To explore the topic, we asked our 200+ telehealth registered nurses (RNs) what patients are telling them about their pandemic-related anxiety, depression or other mental health concerns. Our clinical teams support patients via telehealth services around the nation. Here&rsquo;s what we learned.</p><p><strong>Patients are worried they have COVID-19.</strong></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Symptomatic patients are seeking answers. They have symptoms but are not sure they &lsquo;have the virus.&rsquo; They&rsquo;re told they can&rsquo;t go to work until they get a doctor&rsquo;s note or confirmation they don&rsquo;t have COVID-19. However, they can&rsquo;t be tested. They&rsquo;re afraid to miss work, or they&rsquo;ve already lost their jobs. Individuals with set and limited incomes are struggling to meet basic needs.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Many want testing, so they know if they are spreading COVID-19 to others. But testing is not available or not an option if they don&rsquo;t meet all criteria in their state.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Based on the information about symptoms they are getting from the news and Google searches, many are sure they have coronavirus. They are panicked and don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Many are experiencing a fear of seeking in-person care.</strong></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Many of our callers are refusing to go to an urgent care center or the emergency department for reasons unrelated to COVID-19, out of fear that they will contract the virus. Anxiety and despair are truly apparent in so many of our patients. It crosses all spectrums of age, gender, cultural backgrounds and socioeconomic classes.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Patients with non-COVID-19 issues are terrified to go to the emergency room or urgent care. One caller broke down in tears when I told him to go to the ER. Many patients are looking for home care remedies for things that can&rsquo;t be treated at home.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Patients lack access to their relied-upon care options.</strong></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Some callers are really in a panic when they can&rsquo;t reach their doctor or get the medications refilled that they have been on for many years. Some are psychiatric patients or on narcotic meds, and they know what will happen if they stop their meds &lsquo;cold turkey.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Patients are being forced to let small issues go, like a rash, because the only options at this time are urgent care or the ER. It really gets people worried and fearful when they realize they don&rsquo;t have access to their regular healthcare.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have definitely noticed an increase in anxiety and depression calls. A lot of people are not able to reach their mental health counselors and primary care physicians.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Their anxiety is up because they may have COVID-19 symptom and they want reassurance from their trusted doctor&rsquo;s office, which may be overburdened right now.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Patients are feeling isolated.</strong></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Patients, especially elderly individuals, feel lonely and afraid that no one will be able to help them. Individuals living in retirement and group communities who used to be able to have social activities to keep them engaged are now limited to their own rooms. They&rsquo;re scared and feeling lost. They can&rsquo;t even have their meals together because of social distancing.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Parents who used to count on the support of others to take care of their families are stressed out without help and childcare options.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fear of the unknown and isolation are the two most significant factors I&rsquo;ve seen. They run the gamut in terms of age, too. For example, an 18-year-old caller said he had heart palpitations caused by fear. A 76-year-old caller who lives alone was afraid because he is isolated, low on food and didn&rsquo;t feel he could get the help he needed.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Patients are worried about employment and not having a paycheck and don&rsquo;t know where to turn. These concerns have to be dealt with, so they don&rsquo;t escalate to mental health crisis situations. Nurses are having to work extra hard to find available resources for callers like a food pantry or help them identify coping strategies or support systems.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>For additional insights on mental health and telehealth utilization during the pandemic, please download our <a href="/mental-health-telehealth-and-what-the-pandemic-data-is-telling-us/">interactive trend brief</a>.</p><p>For more analysis of COVID-19 and the role of telehealth services, and best practices for optimized virtual care and engagement, visit our <a href="/category/covid-19/">COVID-19 Resource Center</a>.</p>

							<p>As the reach of the novel coronavirus <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/22/us/coronavirus-death-rates.html?action=click&amp;auth=login-email&amp;login=email&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;utm_campaign=Daily_Newsletter_Daily-Rundown_20200422&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=SFMC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rapidly expanded across the country</a>, the healthcare system has had to adapt and alter how access to care is provided. Many health systems are in trauma mode. Staff at clinics have been moved to COVID-19 care units. Some primary care practices are experiencing <a href="https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/welcome-ad?toURL=/clinical-care/primary-care-providers-blame-covid-19-severe-strain-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">severe strains</a> on resources and finances.</p><p>One result of the crisis has been that people with asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure and other chronic conditions have experienced an unexpected, <a href="https://patientengagementhit.com/news/how-is-coronavirus-affecting-chronic-disease-management-care?eid=CXTEL000000396914&amp;elqCampaignId=14146&amp;utm_source=nl&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter&amp;elqTrackId=436bccf9679542afb0689ee289c0d848&amp;elq=d650074a44fb4357b27619c08be9e7d8&amp;elqaid=14862&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=14146" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sudden shift</a> in how they receive care and guidance. Access to appointments or quick responses from care providers and specialists for low-acuity check-ins are no longer available in many cases.</p><p>Quite a few of these individuals are also putting off care for fear of coming into contact with the coronavirus. A <a href="https://evidation.com/news/covid-19-pulse-first-data-evidation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent COVID-19 study by Evidation</a> found that among the respondents with chronic illnesses, 21% were worried about access to ongoing medical care and 53% were concerned about going to the doctor&rsquo;s office or hospital for necessary care.</p><p>This situation leaves patients with chronic conditions wondering where to turn for guidance to manage issues such as blood glucose levels and fluctuations in blood pressure, and how to stay compliant on medications and treatment.<strong> And as all of us in the industry know all too well, forgoing or delaying care can lead to long-term consequences for patients, outcomes and costs.</strong></p><p>Here are some of the insights we&rsquo;ve heard from our registered nurses (RNs) who take calls on our telehealth&nbsp;<a href="/what-we-do/">nurse triage line</a>:</p><p>&ldquo;There is definite confusion out there. I&rsquo;ve had multiple callers wanting to know if they can double up on their blood pressure meds when readings are elevated.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Some of the most challenging calls are chronic pain patients who have been trying to taper off of controlled substances and now have no access to the resources they were depending on to be successful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hearing from patients who were referred to a specialist and that doctor isn&rsquo;t seeing patients right now, and their symptoms are worse &hellip; small problems become larger problems.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I find that with the diseases such as hypertension, coronary artery disease and diabetes, patients are suffering the most with the inability to maintain their normal routine care. I find quite a few people seeking lab results, having a very hard time getting an answer as to what their results are or an interpretation of them if they do get them.&rdquo;</p><p>Fortunately, many patients have discovered that services provided by telehealth companies are a welcome substitution, especially due to the recent promotion of virtual care and nurse advice lines by the payers and providers that are making healthcare consumers aware of this benefit.</p><p><span style="color: #e23b56; font-size: x-large;"><strong>The rise of telehealth to manage chronic conditions </strong></span></p><p><a href="/what-we-do/">Carenet Health</a> has experienced an uptick&mdash;quite dramatic in some categories&mdash;in telehealth cases since COVID-19 ramped up.</p><table><tbody><tr><th width="50%">Carenet Health telehealth triage cases</th><th width="50%">Comparison of call instances pre-Covid-19 pandemic (February 2 to March 7, 2020) and during COVID-19 pandemic (March 8 to April 14, 2020)</th></tr><tr><td>Nasal allergies</td><td>+394%</td></tr><tr><td>Asthma questions/symptoms/attacks (adult and pediatric)</td><td>+370%</td></tr><tr><td>Headache/migraine</td><td>+57%</td></tr><tr><td>Blood pressure control/high blood pressure</td><td>+43%</td></tr><tr><td>Diabetes-related (including adult, pediatric and pregnancy)</td><td>+15%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Telehealth services and nurse triage support are well suited for the new normal where patients are encouraged to stay home. Just like with in-person appointments, telehealth clinical teams use care protocols based on evidence-based best practices to support patients. Callers get the advice they need to manage chronic conditions, as well as directives on appropriate next steps. Patient needs are addressed in a timely manner and at the appropriate level. For instance, a diabetic may be out of insulin and in need of assistance in getting a prescription filled, and our nurses are there to help coordinate.</p><p><span style="color: #e23b56; font-size: x-large;"><strong>The path forward&mdash;and doing more for patients with chronic conditions</strong></span></p><p>During the pandemic, one focus of nurse advice lines and Virtual Clinics is to help patients stay on course as much as possible with treatment plans. The goal is to prevent the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/04/14/coronavirus-chronic-illness-avoidable-hospital-admissions-column/5134473002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">domino effect</a> on the healthcare system caused by patients who put off care during the pandemic, only to see their conditions worsen in the next few weeks or months.</p><p>Over the longer term, telehealth and remote patient monitoring services can be integrated into <a href="/telehealth-as-a-patient-engagement-solution-how-virtual-care-can-produce-better-outcomes/">patient engagement strategies</a> to improve chronic disease management and <a href="/the-4-es-health-plans-need-to-know-to-improve-medication-adherence/">medication adherence</a> plans. In addition to 24/7 access to nurses and virtual visits with physicians, telehealth companies can provide services that proactively contact patients with personalized touchpoints to monitor and manage chronic conditions, including the <a href="/how-to-motivate-the-medicare-population-to-schedule-appointments-close-care-gaps/">Medicare population</a>.</p><p>Tactics that health plans and providers could consider include:</p><ul><li><strong>One-on-one outreach</strong> &mdash; Personalized contacts via phone, texts and portal chats</li><li><strong>Remote clinical monitoring and coaching</strong> &mdash; Technology solutions that track patients&rsquo; healthcare data and inform meaningful conversations and advice based on results</li><li><strong>Medication check-ins</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; Multiple-touchpoint strategies to ensure patients understand directives and are taking medications as prescribed</li><li><strong>Wellness checks-ins</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; Regular outreach to assess overall physical and mental wellness, access to food and other issues based on patients&rsquo; personal health histories</li></ul><p>As an industry, it&rsquo;s important that we work together to ensure that telehealth is leveraged as a proactive gateway for emergency department diversion, closing care gaps and preventing hospital readmissions.</p><p>For more information, please <a href="/contact/">reach out to us</a>.</p>

							<p>The health and wellbeing impact of the novel coronavirus crisis is reaching beyond the enormous physical health toll. In fact, a concurrent crisis appears to be emerging: &nbsp;The effect of the pandemic on mental health.</p><p>At Carenet Health, we dug into our telehealth triage data&mdash;gathered from supporting tens of thousands of patients per day in March 2020. <strong>Our goal: Collect insights into the rising mental health concerns of those choosing to use virtual care.</strong></p><p>Just one alarming fact: As telehealth patients with COVID-19-related physical health concerns began to decrease, the numbers of behavioral health triage cases increased substantially and quickly. Over a 30-day period during the COVID-19 crisis,&nbsp;Carenet analysis showed a <strong>166% rise in behavioral and mental health telehealth cases.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Read the full brief today.</p>

							<p>When health plans, health systems and other healthcare organizations partner with Carenet Health for their consumer engagement needs, they can count on a Client Success Team that&rsquo;s committed to best-in-class account management. Yet as Vikie Spulak, Carenet&rsquo;s chief client officer says, what that team ultimately delivers is so much more.</p><p>&ldquo;Our client relationship managers absolutely serve as extensions of our clients&rsquo; teams,&rdquo; Spulak said. &ldquo;These are dedicated, seasoned and passionate leaders&nbsp;&nbsp;who excel at understanding and solving for our clients&rsquo; business needs. They know how to remove obstacles and align our work at Carenet to each client&rsquo;s business strategies. They are the liaisons who drive ongoing performance.&rdquo;</p><p>But just as vital, Spulak emphasizes, is the fact that Carenet client relationship managers&nbsp;&nbsp;provide direct access to an ever-growing knowledge base that includes information on everything from consumer needs and expectations during a pandemic to an industry in transition.</p><p><strong>A window into consumer insights</strong></p><p>At&nbsp;<a href="/">Carenet Health</a>, clinical and consumer engagement teams are on the frontlines of connecting with an organization&rsquo;s population on a scale and in ways often not duplicated within the client&rsquo;s internal environment.</p><p>Whether it&rsquo;s outreach that&rsquo;s influencing an individual to&nbsp;<a href="/a-better-engagement-approach-can-close-hedis-gaps/">close important gaps in care</a>, an intimate conversation about disease management or a nurse advice line call with a worried parent, client relationship managers have their fingers on the pulse of those daily interactions. And it means they can readily shed light on and articulate the voice of the consumer, specific to a client&rsquo;s audience.</p><p>&ldquo;That discovered consumer knowledge is intel that&rsquo;s extremely valuable to our clients. Our managers bring what we&rsquo;re hearing from their members to life in ways that reports focused on metrics simply can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Spulak said.</p><p><strong>Diverse, cross-industry engagement view</strong></p><p>Often working as consultants as much as account managers, Carenet&rsquo;s Client Success Team members also bring to the table details of what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not in&nbsp;<a href="/what-we-do/engagement-services/">healthcare engagement</a>, from around the industry and nation.</p><p>Carenet&rsquo;s comprehensive view from supporting hundreds of&nbsp;<a href="/who-we-serve/health-plans/">health insurance companies</a>&nbsp;and other health and wellness organizations empowers team members with a distinct exposure and understanding&mdash;and a responsibility to pass insights along to clients, Spulak noted. The diversity of the populations and regions Carenet serves leads to the continual gathering of learnings to share.</p>

							<p>&ldquo;Our clients are always interested in learning what we&rsquo;re hearing and seeing in other parts of the country, from other types of organizations &hellip; that&rsquo;s knowledge of new ideas and best practices they can&rsquo;t easily gain from anywhere else,&rdquo; Spulak said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a 360-degree perspective of what&rsquo;s going on in the areas of healthcare engagement, clinical support, telehealth and health advocacy.&rdquo;</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t hurt, Spulak added, that many of our client relationship managers have 15 to 20 years of personal experience in consumer engagement, too.</p><p><span style="color: #e23b56;"><strong>Where innovation meets value</strong></span></p><p>Another important contribution the Client Success Team makes is this: Every day, team members oversee the testing of different engagement channels, new scripting and other variables to help clients optimize their efforts. That <a href="/healthcare-engagement-lab-created-for-clients-rapid-optimization-needs/">lab-type atmosphere</a> powers so much of the value the team delivers to clients, Spulak said.</p><p>&ldquo;I tell our clients to think of us an innovation center &hellip; a knowledge bank &hellip; to help you become more successful. It&rsquo;s a huge part of the toolbox we have to help our clients win and grow their business.&rdquo;</p><p>To learn how our teams can help your healthcare organization take patient engagement and health plan member engagement to the next level, <a href="/contact/">contact us today</a>.</p>
