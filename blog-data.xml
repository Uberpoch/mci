                <![CDATA[<p>A FORTUNE Global 10 refinery with sites all over North America engaged TRACK Software to conduct a “parallel pilot” for their upcoming turnaround. For the purposes of the pilot, TRACK™ Platform operated in parallel with existing cost tracking and contractor management processes. The objectives were as follows:</p>
                <!--more-->
                <ul>
                <li>Provide first-hand experience to validate the value and benefits of TRACK Platform</li>
                <li>Provide project data in support of a timely and cost-effective turnaround</li>
                <li>Report contractually-compliant contractor hours and costs, and identify variances against their current, manual process</li>
                </ul>
                TRACK Platform was installed as a SaaS solution (‘software-as-a-service’) and hosted by TRACK Software – requiring only a web client at the customer site. TRACK Software consultants were on-site during the 30-day turnaround to perform daily operations, resolve data exceptions, and allocate hours and costs to validated work orders.
                <p>There were two major findings:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Cost tracking and reporting, as implemented at the plant, is resource intensive and does not provide the accurate real-time information needed to proactively manage and control costs, especially during a fast-paced turnaround.</li>
                <li>Refinery’s cost accounting and invoicing processes are heavily dependent on the accuracy of vendor inputs and provide for limited verification of service receipts. For the turnaround period (Oct-3 to Nov-3), TRACK Platform calculated a 10% overstatement of contractor billable hours, representing a potential savings of <span><strong>$648,000</strong></span>.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>The Current Process</strong><br>The current turnaround cost tracking processes at the refinery demonstrated a number of fundamental issues:
                <ul>
                <li>Cost analysts are consumed with data collection and reporting activities; little time available for analysis.</li>
                <li>The primary cost control mechanism is the budget (spending up to the budget number is expected).</li>
                <li>Cost collection is an accurate process separate from vendor invoicing and verification.</li>
                <li>Cost reporting is not timely (cost meeting every other day due to workload and limited resources).</li>
                <li>Labor, material and equipment charges are not validated by contractual terms and conditions.</li>
                <li>Work completion (percent) is not routinely input on the cost sheets; precluding final cost projections.</li>
                <li>Excel spreadsheet is cumbersome (updated manually, single user access, frequent format changes).</li>
                <li>Little or no cost information received from outside service vendors (invoice submitted post-turnaround).</li>
                <li>SAP service and timesheet entries are approved without first-hand knowledge of service receipts.</li>
                <li>Lack of vendor discipline impacts the ability to capture costs accurately on a daily basis.</li>
                <li>Contract rate schedules, terms conditions are not current or readily available for the cost analyst.</li>
                <li>Special deals (fixed fees, consolidated-skill rates, inclusive rates, etc.) are not well communicated.</li>
                <li>Gate logs are not complete for the audit process (missing badge events).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Approach</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Five turnaround contractors were identified and corresponding master data was gathered and loaded: commercial terms conditions, contractor personnel, schedules, crafts, and rates.</li>
                <li>Active work orders were identified and entered into TRACK Platform at each of the three units. These work orders form the basis for cost allocation and reporting.</li>
                <li>TRACK’s SaaS service was deployed in Houston for the parallel pilot. Database backups were performed nightly to ensure the integrity of the plant’s data. Uptime availability of the system during the turnaround was 100%. Transaction response times were measured typically in the range of 1-3 seconds.</li>
                <li>Gate card reads were extracted from the plant’s access control system on a nightly basis and transmitted via the Web for processing. On-site, net-billable hours and contractually complaint costs were calculated by TRACK for Time Materials labor.</li>
                <li>TRACK Platform Software consultants performed daily operations to resolve data exceptions and allocate hours and costs to validated work orders.</li>
                <li>Comparison of contractor hours and costs by day identifying variances in reported costs versus TRACK gate validation and automated calculations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Work Process Comparison</strong><br>The plant’s existing cost tracking and reporting process are separate from the vendor’s invoice and payment stream; a parallel operation, Therefore, cost tracking and reporting is an overhead process dependent upon the discipline of the vendor for accurate inputs. Because the reporting stream is separate from the invoice process, the two systems are subject to discrepancies that will not be apparent until the vendor submits an invoice for payment.</p>
                <p>TRACK Platform integrates daily cost collection and reporting with the vendor’s invoicing process. This is done by providing an interface of authorized charges to the owner’s Accounts Payable system and to the contractor. The contractor is paid through the reconciling of hours and costs in TRACK Platform. The daily acceptance of charges by the contractor and the authorization of charges by the owner results in a single, accurate and real-time source of cost information.</p>
                <p>In just 30 days, the parallel pilot demonstrated that TRACK Platform would have saved the plant nearly $650,000 during their 30-day turnaround.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>A Fortune Global 5 Refinery asked MCi to provide an analysis of three contractor labor invoices for a 45 day period during their Spring Turnaround. By automatically applying the contractual terms and conditions, the actual access control system in/out events, and the skills and schedules for each contractor, <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the TRACK Platform </a>identified $2.1 million of overpaid time in the span of 6 weeks. Extrapolating the 45-day loss, assuming a refinery has two Turnarounds a year and uses contractors for routine maintenance, the refinery is conservatively losing approximately $10 million a year in contractor labor billing.</p>
                <!--more-->
                <h3>Result Details</h3>
                <p>The owner provided TRACK with the original invoices for the 3 contractors involved in the analysis. The first table summarizes the invoices by Straight Time, Over Time and Double Time for a total spend of $18.1 million.</p>

                <p>Once the ACS Gate Log was automated and the owner’s pay rules and schedules applied, there was a significant decrease of Straight Time, Over Time and Double Time for a savings of 11.7%. These savings originated from offsite work validated by the owner, early out gate punches, late arrival gate punches and various other situations that weren’t aligned with the Term and Condition’s of the contract.</p>
                <p>The table below shows the total calculations and what should have been invoiced and paid by the owner. The Owner paid $18MM for just these three contractors during the 45-day turnaround when they should have paid $2.1MM less.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Contractor Findings</h2>
                <p>Each contractor was analyzed fully and detailed below are the various findings. As you can see, each contractor had varying degrees of contractual compliance issues:</p>
                <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                <h3><strong>Contractor 1</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Hours on the invoice appear to be based on time-on-site rather than scheduled time.</li>
                <li>Billable time is routinely rounded up to the next half-hour increment. Even when only a few minutes of the half-hour is worked, the entire half-hour increment is billed.</li>
                <li>There are 479 occurrences of personnel arriving more than five minutes late.</li>
                <li>There are 906 occurrences of personnel exiting the refinery 10-20 minutes early.</li>
                <li>There are 223 occurrences where onsite time is less than two hours, but the corresponding invoice time is greater than four hours.</li>
                <li>Out of 7,254 invoice-detail lines, <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TRACK Platform</a> found 4,546 discrepancies -- some of which are legitimate differences due to off-site work, etc.</li>
                <li>Out of 7,254 invoice-detail lines, 3,270 have discrepancies of two hours or less. This is significant because smaller variations are less likely to be explained as off-site work.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The TRACK Platform</a>-calculated invoice error rate is 8.89% on hours and 12.87% on dollars.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                <h3><strong>Contractor 2</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                <li>On five occasions, it appears that a four-hour minimum was used for billing. Procurement indicates that a two-hour minimum is contractual. Contract compliance is difficult when left to manual processes.</li>
                <li>There are 23 occurrences of personnel arriving more than five minutes late.</li>
                <li>There are 482 occurrences of personnel exiting the refinery 10-20 minutes early.</li>
                <li>Out of 8,941 invoice-detail lines, <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TRACK Platform</a> found 3,041 discrepancies, some of which are legitimate differences due to off-site work.</li>
                <li>Out of 8,941 invoice-detail lines, 2,267 have discrepancies of two hours or less.</li>
                <li>
                <p class=""><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The TRACK Platform</a>-calculated invoice error rate is 4.99% on hours and 7.15% on dollars.</p>
                </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                <h3><strong>Contractor 3</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Hours on the invoice appear to be based on time calculated from first-in to last-out badge events. This method discounts interim time off-site and doesn't account for hours worked within schedule.</li>
                <li>A two-hour minimum was applied to all personnel regardless of hours worked.</li>
                <li>There are 23 occurrences of personnel arriving more than five minutes late.</li>
                <li>There are 994 occurrences of personnel exiting the refinery 5-10 minutes early.</li>
                <li>There are 24 occurrences of personnel exiting the refinery 10-20 minutes early.</li>
                <li>Out of the 6,315 invoice-detail lines, <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TRACK Platform</a> found 918 discrepancies, some of which are legitimate differences due to off-site work.</li>
                <li>Out of 6,315 invoice-detail lines, 610 have discrepancies of two hours or less.</li>
                <li>The <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TRACK Platform</a>-calculated invoice error rate is 3.58% on hours and 4.39% on dollars.</li>

                <![CDATA[<h2><strong>MAXIMIZE YOUR RENTAL EQUIPMENT UTILIZATION</strong></h2>
                <img src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/6486746/Blog%20Images/Management%20Controls%20Yanic1.jpg" alt="Management Controls Yanic1" width="300" style="width: 300px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;">
                <div><br>
                <div>
                <p>Management Controls, Inc. (MCi) is excited to announce the Phase 1 release of its rental equipment integration with United Rentals. This integration allows for United Rentals equipment invoices to be electronically generated against valid cost objects (Purchase Orders and Work Orders) received from TRACK Platform and sent to the TRACK Platform Material Module for processing. Users then follow the standard TRACK Platform Acceptance and Authorization processes for sending United Rental invoices from TRACK Platform to the customers’ ERP for payment.</p>
                <!--more-->
                <div>
                <p>This integration enables TRACK Platform owners to streamline their United Rentals invoicing process and manage rental equipment in addition to contractor-owned equipment. Through the increased visibility of rental equipment costs, customers can leverage the data to make better business decisions and optimize their rental equipment usage.</p>
                <p>MCi and United Rentals are continuing to work on adding more capability and control on rental equipment. Our objectives in 2020 are to leverage the benefits and controls of the TRACK Platform labor module and apply best practices from the rental equipment industry to enhance the management of rental equipment.</p>
                <hr></div>
                <h3><strong>KEY BENEFITS </strong></h3>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Upfront Validation Review - </strong>TRACK Platform cost objects (Purchase Orders, Work Orders, etc.) are validated vs. those received by United Rentals when preparing their invoices to ensure they are active and can receive additional charges.</li>
                <li><strong>Billing Timeliness - </strong>Once invoices are prepared using valid cost objects, United Rentals invoices are automatically sent to TRACK Platform on a predefined time interval.</li>
                <li><strong>Process Efficiency - </strong>Customers will no longer have to go into multiple systems to review and process United Rental invoices.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimum Reconciliation - </strong>Reduce re-work and invoice disputes via upfront cost object validation and field approval (TRACK Platform Authorization Process).</li>
                <li><strong>Timely Spend Visibility - </strong>Real-time visibility and/or reporting of United Rentals Equipment costs within TRACK.Platform</li>
                <li><strong>Manage Equipment Spend - </strong>The integration provides customers with a holistic view of total equipment costs by enabling owners to manage equipment spending in one place.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>TRACK Anywhere equips managers with a convenient and powerful way to track remote workforces, no matter where the job takes them.</p>
                <p>(Houston, TX ) <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/" rel=" noopener">Management Controls, Inc.</a> (MCi), the global leader of enterprise contractor management software, is proud to announce the launch of TRACK Anywhere, a suite of mobile applications purpose-built for managing remote workforces.</p>
                <!--more-->
                <p>MCi’s <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel=" noopener">TRACK Platform</a> provides business owners with a comprehensive automated software solution for managing contractor labor, equipment, and materials costs across their enterprise. For over 30 years, companies across a broad range of industries have relied on the TRACK Platform for automated contract compliance, eliminating invoice disputes and possible over/underpayments. Now, with the introduction of TRACK Anywhere, businesses can manage their remote workforce as well.</p>
                <p>The <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track-anywhere" rel=" noopener">TRACK Anywhere</a> suite provides business owners with real-time visibility into manpower and costs in the field through two innovative applications. First, TRACK Virtual Gate enables contract employees to badge in and out from remote locations, as well as enter field notes and photographic documentation of their activities. The cross-platform application runs on both iOS and Android devices, giving contractors a convenient way to log their work while providing their employers with total transparency via geo-boundaries and GPS data.</p>
                <p>{{cta('3e4e3b88-e3c1-4189-bc21-4d9899f47480')}}</p>
                <p>Second, TRACK Kiosk lets contractors conveniently scan QR coded badges or RFID badges as they enter the premises or worksite, providing a streamlined way for businesses to manage remote worksites. With GPS location enabled, customers and vendors are able to validate workers are in the right place at the right time. Additionally, the TRACK Kiosk provides the ability to validate Contractor Pre-Qualification requirements such as proper insurance requirements and appropriate training certifications are in place prior to entering the work location thus reducing potential liability. The portable tablet device can be moved from to each new work location, allowing managers to maintain oversight of their crews no matter where the job takes them. The intrinsically safe, ruggedized tablet can also be mounted at a fixed entry point for ease of use.</p>
                <p>MCi President Ken Naughton says the new TRACK Anywhere product suite was designed to give businesses greater insight across all their contractor activity. “We know that for many companies, remote worksites are an essential part of doing business – but it can be a real challenge to get a clear picture of who was on site and what they should be paid. We can now bring the power of the TRACK Platform to non-fenced work locations such as pipelines, power distribution &amp; transmission lines, offshore platforms, railways, and construction sites. These industries have the opportunity to achieve the tremendous savings the refining and chemical industries have been saving for over 30 years.” &nbsp;</p>

                <p><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"><span>Dear Valued Partners,</span><span> </span></span></p>
                <p><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">All of us from MCi wish  that you and your families are well &amp; safe during this COVID-19 pandemic. We are here to support you in any way we can. </span><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"> </span></p>
                <p><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">To show our support and continued dedication  to our partners, we have enabled our <strong>Stay on TRACK: Remote Implementation &amp; Training </strong>strategy in response to COVID-19. We have already been utilizing this strategy during the pandemic with our clients and have </span><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">proven the ability to perform all aspects of delivering remote TRACK Implementation’s and training support to all users remotely. Our Consulting experts are here to deliver high-quality implementations, training, documentation, and support to our Client’s TRACK users no matter their location.  </span></p>
                <div>
                <p><span> </span><span><strong>Stay on TRACK </strong></span><span> focuses on creating&nbsp;best practices and&nbsp;remote&nbsp;project&nbsp;plans for TRACK&nbsp;implementations. Specific implementation plans were developed for following project milestones: </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
                <li><span><strong>Business Requirements Workshop</strong></span><span> </span></li>
                <li><span><strong>Project Kickoff Week</strong></span><span> </span></li>
                <li><span><strong>Training &amp; Hypercare</strong></span><span> </span></li>
                </ul>
                <h3><span><strong>Business Requirements Workshop</strong></span><span> </span><span>&nbsp;</span></h3>
                <p><span>The Business Requirements Workshop (BRW) occurs before the project kickoff in order to introduce TRACK at a granular level to key stakeholders and ensure a consistent level of understanding. During the workshop, the client makes key implementation decisions, determines business requirements and plans for change management. The BRW drives all future activities and directly impacts the quality of the upcoming implementation.  </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                <h3><span><strong>Project Kickoff Week</strong></span><span> </span><span>&nbsp;</span></h3>
                <p><span>The Project Kickoff is the first week of the implementation. During the Project Kickoff, the MCi and Client implementation teams present an overview of the current state, the TRACK solution, project timeline, and deliverables to site leadership. Current business processes are reviewed with key stakeholders and decisions are made to define the TRACK to-be process, roles and responsibilities. Project Kickoff activities are conducted in several focused video conference calls over the course of a week and attended by the Client project team and key stakeholders to match the meeting topic.  </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                <h3><span><strong>Training &amp; Hypercare </strong></span><span> </span><span>&nbsp;</span></h3>
                <p><span>TRACK training occurs the week before Go Live for Vendor Timekeepers and Client Authorizers. Go Live support and follow-up training will occur during the TRACK Hypercare phase post-Go Live. MCi provides individualized and focused training sessions directly with Client Vendors and Authorizers to ensure they gain a complete understanding of the TRACK software. Individualized support and follow-up training will continue with TRACK users through the Hypercare phase of the project. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><!--more--><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">(Houston, TX) Management Controls Inc. (MCi) is excited to announce the launch of TRACK University, an eLearning platform that will serve as a distance learning tool for all MCi’s SaaS products.</span></p>
                <div>Distance learning has become more prevalent in driving consistency and cost controls in organizations across the globe. It is a necessity for organizations to quickly address training needs for new employees, whether that is in the office or working remotely.&nbsp;</div>
                <p><span style="background-color: transparent;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">TRACK University is packed with courses designed for all the different user-specific roles within the TRACK Platform to fight the forgetting curve and drive the speed of TRACK adoption within organizations. Within TRACK University, users will experience different training principles that will deliver TRACK learning based on the individuals learning preferences, through video learning and post-course quizzes to test the learning.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
                <h5 style="text-align: center;"><em>Studies have shown that 65% of people are visual learners and that quizzes inside of </em><em>e</em><em>Learning&nbsp;have a 20% higher impact on post training efficiencies! </em></h5>
                <p>TRACK University will also offer certifications for completing user-specific learning plans. For the initial release, there will be learning plans and certifications available for Vendor Timekeepers. There will be additional learning plans and certifications for TRACK Coordinators and TRACK Authorizers becoming available throughout the year.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p><span><img src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/6486746/TRACK%20Software%20Release-100-2.jpg" alt="TRACK Software Release-100-2" width="673" style="width: 673px;"></span></p>
                <p><em>Management Controls, Inc has released new performance enhancements to the TRACK Platform in the latest April software release.</em></p>
                <!--more-->
                <p>We are excited to announce several key performance enhancements made to the TRACK Platform this weekend, including the launch of TRACK University. We are regularly working to identify and address issues our customers may face while using TRACK. We think the latest enhancements will improve the user experience for each of our customers!</p>
                <h3><strong>Authorization Central Performance</strong></h3>
                <p>We found that even though authorizations are a key part of the TRACK Daily Settlement Process, pending authorizations could load slowly depending on the size of the data-set, causing Authorizers to spend too much time in TRACK, distracting them from their role of managing contractors in the field. Because of this, we have launched Express Central which is a new way for Authorizers to perform their authorizations faster! In Express Central, Authorizers will experience improved performance with no change to the core functionality of Authorization Central. Express Central processes the authorization in the background to reduce the time users spend completing authorizations each day. Pending Authorization Alerts are available via email to provide context for pending allocations that are awaiting processing authorizers. This process allows Authorizers to quickly manage their authorizations and spend more time in the field.</p>
                <h3><strong>Human&nbsp;</strong>Performance</h3>
                <p>Employees in roles that use and manage TRACK change over time and may not receive formal training to the level necessary to complete their work effectively. Additionally, the forgetting curve tells us that participants forget 42% of what they learn 20 minutes after learning completes. We have launched TRACK University for roles that are specific to using TRACK. TRACK University helps learning retention, reduces training time and provides quick access to key information when and where it is needed.&nbsp; Learners receive quality training, with minimum impact to the operations of the organization, when and where they need it most. User can access the newly launched TRACK University by clicking the new “TRACK U” icon on the home page of TRACK.</p>
                <p>{{cta('7bfb0953-bbf0-499b-b8d8-84ae6cbc41bd')}}</p>
                <h3><strong>Reporting Performance</strong></h3>
                <p>We found that running reports from TRACK can be a slow process when large data sets are selected using the Full Data Extract. This leads to reports hanging or failing to run at all causing frustration and down-time. With the latest release, users will now experience improved performance while running the Full Data Extract, as it retrieves data more efficiently.</p>
                <h3><strong>Cloud Infrastructure Performance</strong></h3>
                <p>Finally, we found that using the Microsoft classic cloud infrastructure limited MCi’s ability to provide an optimal user experience for our clients. Migrating to the new Microsoft Azure Cloud Infrastructure enables increased performance and response times in the TRACK application. This will improve the response time and performance of all products within the TRACK Platform.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>*Performance Updates are released for customers in the cloud</p>]]>

                <p>John Wanamaker, the pioneering US department store magnate, once remarked: “Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted. The trouble is, I don't know which half.”</p>
                <p>Does your industrial company share Mr. Wanamaker’s problem when it comes to managing shutdowns, turnarounds, outages, other major projects, and even routine maintenance that involve thousands of contractors, months of disruption and tens of millions of dollars?</p>
                <p>If you have a large contractor workforce, and if your company is typical, you may be <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/industries-and-overbilling" rel="noopener" target="_blank">overpaying</a> your contractors by roughly 15% each year. But unlike Mr. Wanamaker, you can discover how—and then do something about it.</p>
                <p><!--more--></p>
                <h3>The Importance of Project Metrics</h3>
                <p>You can only manage what you measure. If you need to manage your costs for contractor-owned labor, materials and equipment, you must establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that reveal the level of success or failure of each project.</p>
                <p>You must establish your KPIs because the cost of failure is high. Projects in the industrial sector (<a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/oilandgas" rel="noopener" target="_blank">oil &amp; gas</a>, <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/metalsandmining" rel="noopener" target="_blank">metals &amp; mining</a>, <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/pulpandpaper" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pulp &amp; paper</a>, <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/chemicals" rel="noopener" target="_blank">chemicals</a>, <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/utilities" rel="noopener" target="_blank">utilities</a>, <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/manufacturing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">manufacturing</a>) are large. <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/shutdown-turnaround-outage" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Shutdowns, turnarounds and outages</a> typically last 60 days and can cost around $50 million to complete. Not to mention the added costs of missing your targets. McKinsey &amp; Company estimates that construction projects are typically completed 80% over budget and take 20% longer than forecast.</p>
                <p>These projects require an increase in contractor headcount coming into your worksite to complete the project. If there are thousands of workers on your site and you aren’t tracking project completion at the work level, then your projects will get out of hand rapidly. You will blow your budget and your timeline—and be forced to find more money and extend the project timeline.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>What Kinds of Project Metrics Should You Track?</h3>
                <p>As you know, planning a major project takes years, and involves estimating totals for everything that comes with a cost, particularly labor. You estimate, for example, how many hours need to be worked on each part of your plant or site, such as 1,000 hours of welding, 600 hours of pipefitting and 200 hours of electrical.</p>
                <p>But the key to monitoring and managing the success of your project isn’t just to <em>establish</em> <a href="/stay-on-track-remote-implementations-and-training" rel=" noopener">metrics.</a> The key is to regularly compare estimates with actuals.</p>
                <p>You must compare:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Actual Work Hours versus Estimated Work Hours</li>
                <li>Actual Costs versus Estimated Costs</li>
                <li>Actual Completion Rates versus Estimated Completion Rates</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You should also change the way you collect data when calculating Earned Value Management (EVM). Most companies use EVM to uncover variances in projects by comparing work performed with work planned. But their major challenge is consolidating project-progress data from multiple systems at regular intervals.</p>
                <p>Inconsistent and untimely data leads to errors in reporting, and also leads to false conclusions about project performance. The solution is to use a system that gathers the data automatically. This eliminates manual data entry, makes the collection process consistent, and improves the accuracy of EVM calculations.</p>
                <h3>How to Master Your Metrics</h3>
                <p>The key to mastering your metrics is real-time insights, increased transparency and time-saving automation.</p>
                <h3>Real-Time Insights</h3>
                <p>The problem that many industrial companies face is that they use multiple tools or spreadsheets to track and forecast projects. These tools and spreadsheets don’t talk to each other, so they don’t deliver the real-time insights that companies need. The solution is to use an <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/insights" rel="noopener" target="_blank">integrated contractor management</a> solution that provides daily updates on contractor performance, cost control and compliance.</p>
                <h3>Increased T<span style="font-weight: normal;">ransparency</span></h3>
                <p>The next challenge that industrial firms face is that their estimated “actuals” are inaccurate. Plus, they receive this information after the fact. For example, the welders only worked 80 hours today but they were supposed to work 150 hours. But the project controls group won’t know this until next week because of the manual processes of submitting timesheets and invoices. The solution is <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">contractor management software</a> that delivers visibility, transparency and velocity into your daily contractors’ spend.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Time-Saving A<span style="font-weight: normal;">utomation</span></h3>
                <p>The final challenge that industrial firms have when managing thousands of contract workers over multiple months is manually reconciling thousands of invoices against contracts. This is why some turnaround managers need six months to close out their projects. This is why <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/administrationaudit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">contractor audits</a> take 12 months. The solution is <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/proof-of-presence" rel="noopener" target="_blank">automation.</a></p>
                <p>Today’s contractor management software tracks labor, materials and equipment automatically. Automated collection of contractor work activity ensures accuracy and delivers controls. Automating the contractor payment process significantly reduces audit and reconciliation time. Automation helps you control, manage and reduce contractor labor, equipment and materials spend.</p>
                <h3>Case Study</h3>
                <p>A Fortune<sup>®</sup> Global 5 refinery asked <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Management Controls</a> to analyze three contractor labor invoices for a 45-day period during their Spring Turnaround.</p>
                <p>Using our <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TRACK<sup>®</sup> Software</a>, we calculated the net time for all the contract employees and compared it to the invoices the refinery paid. We automated the contract terms and conditions for each contractor, imported the access control system in/out events and applied the same skills and schedules that were used during the turnaround.</p>
                <p>TRACK identified a significant difference between the calculated net time and the actual invoice. TRACK discovered $2.1 million in labor savings for the six weeks evaluated.</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">More</h3>
                <p>Learn how a global mining leader with 35% of total spending allocated to labor wages saved more than 12% on their annual contractor spend through automating <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/contracts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">contract compliance</a> and gaining real-time visibility and control of daily operations. <a href="https://info.managementcontrols.com/global-mining-case-study">Read the case study</a>.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p><em><img src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/6486746/Software%20Release.jpg" alt="Software Release" width="627" style="width: 627px;">Management Controls Inc. has released new process optimization enhancements to the TRACK Platform in the latest June software release.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
                <!--more-->
                <p>We are excited to announce that we are launching new process optimization enhancements to the TRACK Platform this month! We are always working to identify problems our customers are having while using TRACK and strive to create the best solutions we can.</p>
                <h4><strong>Override Management</strong></h4>
                <p>With our latest release, our customers can now require attachments for an override request. During the override management process, it could be a challenge to know if an override request was previously approved by an Authorizer. This led to either reduced cost visibility due to blanket override approvals or additional administrative work to contact Authorizers before approving requests. Customers can now enable override attachments and configure which override reasons need to have documentation attached. This will help to reduce costs that aren’t accounted for, reduce extra administrative work, and provide an audit history to support override approvals.</p>
                <h4><strong>Alert Management</strong></h4>
                <p>Track Coordinators can now manage key settings and set-up alerts for other users inside of the TRACK Platform. &nbsp;Track Coordinators can bulk edit the preferences for how their team receives TRACK alerts. Each team member can change their own preferences at any time, but the Track Coordinator can then see what the updated preference is. This allows Authorizers and Timekeepers to not have to spend the time setting up alerts as well as allows Track Coordinators to see how their team is seeing alerts. This means that the new alert management makes the process more efficient for the entire team using the TRACK Platform.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track-anywhere" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/6486746/Kiosk%20Muster%20Graphic-100.jpg" alt="Kiosk Muster Graphic-100" width="670" style="width: 670px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"></a></p>
                <h4><strong>Remote Mustering&nbsp;</strong></h4>
                <p>When a mustering event occurs either onsite or at remote work locations, users with the TRACK Anywhere Kiosk can now enable the Kiosk Mustering feature to see who is and isn’t at a muster point during emergency situations, in real-time. Users can select the Muster option in the Kiosk menu, choose whether they want workers to scan an RFID badge or a QR code, then all workers can check in at the Kiosk muster station in minutes. Owners will easily be able to see who has mustered and who hasn’t via a web browser on any device. This will help improve visibility and safety of workers at remote locations during emergency situations!</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track-university" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/6486746/TRACK%20U%20Blog%20Break-100-2.jpg" alt="TRACK U Blog Break-100-2" width="670" style="width: 670px;"></a></p>
                <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
                <h4><strong>What's new in TRACK U?</strong></h4>
                <p>We have added courses into TRACK University covering the new features added this month!</p>
                <ul>
                <li><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">Add an Override Reason</span></li>
                <li><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">Alert Management Tool</span></li>
                <li><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">View Overrides Requests and History</span></li>
                <li><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">Request Override Hours</span></li>
                <li><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">Approve or Reject Override Request</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>We believe each of these enhancements will solve problems our customers are having and allow them to do business each<span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"> day in a more effective and efficient way.</span></p>

                <![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Stock%20images/Warehouse%20worker%20and%20manager%20looking%20at%20laptop%20in%20a%20large%20warehouse.jpeg" alt="Warehouse worker and manager looking at laptop in a large warehouse" width="627" style="width: 627px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <span>How you can achieve visibility, control, and cost savings, by combining advanced technology with key industry best practices.</span></em></p>
                <!--more-->
                <p>Proper project planning doesn’t always avoid the unforeseen circumstances that can cause your routine <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/maintenance" rel="noopener" target="_blank">maintenance</a>, <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/shutdown-turnaround-outage" rel="noopener" target="_blank">turnaround, outage, or shutdown project</a> to become completely behind schedule and over budget.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Adding to that challenge is the complex owner/contractor relationship which involves hundreds or thousands of craftsmen, each with very specific contract permutations. Because of unforeseen problems, combined with the complexity of contracts, it’s no wonder that projects are often millions of dollars over budget and notoriously late.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In addition, the demand for plant contractors is growing due to a shortage of skilled workers, aging equipment, and growing business requirements. The processes for managing these contractors have traditionally been based on manual time methods that result in errors, disputes, lack of visibility, and control.</p>
                <p>World-class companies, however, are realizing that they can address these challenges, achieving visibility, control, and cost savings, by combining advanced technology with key industry best practices. Using Contractor Spend Management technology exclusive to MCi’s <a href="http://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TRACK® Platform</a>, manufacturers can automate all processes — from contractor time-sheets that are validated through proof of presence, accurate skill assignment, and adherence to contractual terms and conditions through invoicing to payment, giving them real-time visibility to avoid cost overruns, as well as an automated payment process that ensures that contractors are paid accurately, on time.</p>
                <p>Supported by today’s innovative technology, the following are best practices that best-in-class companies are implementing:</p>
                <h4 style="text-align: left;">REAL-TIME METRICS</h4>
                <p><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Blog%20Images-02.jpg" alt="Blog Images-02" width="250" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: right;">Provide visibility into such critical information as planned and real-time headcount by contractor, skill, and shift; equipment and materials required by contractor and shift; notification of absent labor and missing equipment; cumulative hours and costs at the work order and activity level; planned vs. actual variance reporting of final costs; and any purchase orders (PO’s) and work orders (WO’s) that exceed planned hours and cost. Metrics should also offer electronic contractor time-sheets and invoices that are in compliance with contracts.</p>
                <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
                <h4 style="text-align: left;">ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEMS</h4>
                <p><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Blog%20Images-01.jpg" alt="Blog Images-01" width="250" style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;">Are critical for security and can also support other business processes. They make excellent employee and contractor on-site validation records;&nbsp;help eliminate billing errors and can play a major role in a company’s insurance and risk management practices.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4 style="text-align: left;">SMART CONTRACTS</h4>
                <p><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Blog%20Images-03.jpg" alt="Blog Images-03" width="250" style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;">Should be guided by the company’s approach to contractor staff levels and the nature of contractor/owner relationships. Smart contracts match work risk to contract type, with Lump Sum contracts, ensuring good scope; Unit Rate contracts, to improve productivity and control costs; Time &amp; Materials work, to address labor, equipment, and materials.</p>
                <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
                <h4>WORK PLANNING AND SCHEDULING</h4>
                <p><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Blog%20Images-04.jpg" alt="Blog Images-04" width="250" style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;">Are critical to evaluating effectiveness, costs, and performance. Progress, cost, and status measurement are only meaningful in the context of an up-to-date plan. Whenever possible, standardize on one CMMS(computerized maintenance management software). It also is important to use real-time progress/status feedback provided by a Contractor Management solution, like the TRACK Platform, so you can pro-actively adjust the plan and the schedule.</p>
                <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
                <h4>ERP INTEGRATION</h4>
                <p><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Blog%20Images-05.jpg" alt="Blog Images-05" width="250" style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;">Is important for efficiency and communication. It enables, for example, a work order to be downloaded to the TRACK Platform, where it automatically updates the ERP with operation, work order, and project status and costs throughout the day. After the software approves the invoice for payment, it generates electronic charges that are updated in the ERP system for settlement.</p>
                <p>By combining advanced technology with world-class best practices, manufacturers can avoid many of the headaches associated with time overruns and save millions of dollars a year, while gaining critical visibility into real-time project status. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]>

                <!--more-->
                <p>We are excited to announce that we are launching new data efficiencies to the TRACK Platform this month! We are always working to identify opportunities to improve the customer experience and create the best solutions we can.</p>
                <p><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Auth%20Reassignment-100-2.jpg" alt="Auth Reassignment-100-2" width="673" style="width: 673px;"></p>
                <h4><strong>Pro-actively Reassign Authorizations&nbsp;</strong></h4>
                <p>When Track Authorizers are out of the office, pending authorizations build up and can slow down the daily settlement process. This can cause vendor payments to be delayed until they return. Now, Track Authorizers can temporarily reassign authorizations for a selected date range before leaving the office for extended periods of time. Track Coordinators are now also able to manage authorization reassignments if needed.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <h4><strong>Equipment Activity Total Hours Enhancement</strong></h4>
                <p>When entering equipment utilization hours, the TRACK Platform has required the start and end times to be entered for each piece of equipment used. In the latest release, we have made it easier for timekeepers to enter equipment utilization data by giving users the ability to enter the total hours of equipment utilization, without having to enter the start and end times. This new enhancement will make entering equipment utilization data more efficient for timekeepers.</p>
                <h4>Improved Equipment Utilization &amp; Allocation Importing</h4>
                <p>To utilize imports for equipment utilization and allocation, Vendor Timekeepers have had to fill out two imports separately that lead to extra work and duplication of effort. With the latest software release, Vendor Timekeepers have an option to complete and load one import for equipment utilization and allocation that includes the capability to enter total equipment utilization without the IN / OUT times. This enhancement will help timekeepers to save time, increase efficiency, and reduce potential errors.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We believe these new enhancements will prevent issues from slowing down the daily process for our customers and improve efficiency while working in TRACK.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p><em><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/October%20Release%20blog%20image-1.jpg" alt="October Release blog image-1" width="627" style="width: 627px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></em></p>
                <p><em>Management Controls, Inc. launches new software release in October to improve the user experience within the TRACK Platform.</em></p>
                <!--more-->
                <p>We are regularly looking for business problem<span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">s our customers experience and how we can solve them through the TRACK Platform. Each of the items in our latest experience improvements release has been designed to solve specific problems TRACK users are facing to improve the daily settlement process and increase overall user experience!</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4><em style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Credits-100.jpg" alt="Credits-100" width="673" style="width: 673px;"></em></h4>
                <h4><strong>Credits</strong></h4>
                <p>Sometimes, contractors require credit payments to the owner or need to make a change to a charge already made. The TRACK Platform and ERP systems previously could not communicate this change requiring the contractor and owner to go through several manual steps to be on the same page. The TRACK Platform will now be able to sync credits with ERP systems causing fewer headaches and an increase in efficiency for both the contractor and owner. There is some configuration needed from MCi in order to use this function and it is only available for certain ERP systems at this time, but it will soon be available for everyone. Please contact your MCi Account Manager if you are interested in the credits enhancements!</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Authorization%20Enhancements_Authorization%20Enhancements.jpg" alt="Authorization Enhancements_Authorization Enhancements" width="1280" style="width: 1280px;"></h4>
                <h4><strong>Authorization Enhancements</strong></h4>
                <p>Track Authorizers can spend too much time authorizing low-risk accepted allocations that could have been spent in the field overseeing work. Track Coordinators now have the option to change the settings within TRACK to allow Track Authorizers to authorize a selection of accepted allocations that are low-risk and do not have exceptions. The new enhancement will assist Authorizers in their daily review process by allowing a simple selection of accepted allocations that do not have exceptions, reducing time to authorize low-risk items.</p>
                <h4><strong>Authorization Comments</strong></h4>
                <p>There are instances where Track Authorizers need to hold off authorizing an allocation because of contractual agreements. In the past, Track Authorizers would end up reviewing the same items several times while Track Coordinators and Vendor Timekeepers were kept in the dark on why the daily settlement process was being delayed. Now, Authorizers can add comments during the Authorization process that are saved and can be revisited later both on screen and in reports, which can be accessed by Authorizer, Track Coordinators, and Vendor Timekeepers.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Override%20Enhancements_Override%20Enhancements-03.jpg" alt="Override Enhancements_Override Enhancements-03" width="1280" style="width: 1280px;"></h4>
                <h4>Override Enhancements</h4>
                <p>When we launched the ability to require attachments to overrides, we launched it in phases. The first phase only let users view the attachments during the initial review of the override. Now, users will be able to view override attachments throughout the entire daily settlement process. This will not only make the process more efficient, but it will also provide historic information when audits are needed.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Field%20Notes%20Enhancements_Override%20Enhancements-04.jpg" alt="Field Notes Enhancements_Override Enhancements-04" width="1280" style="width: 1280px;"></h4>
                <h4>Field Notes Enhancements</h4>
                <p>Track Authorizers previously could not see field notes added to show what work was completed and how the project was progressing when going through activity keeping them out of the loop. Now, Track Authorizers can be on the same page as the rest of the team with visibility into the field notes attached to the allocated activity.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/User%20Creation%20Enhancements%202-05.jpg" alt="User Creation Enhancements 2-05" width="673" style="width: 673px;"></h4>
                <h4>User Creation Enhancements</h4>
                <p>In the past, Track Coordinators could have extra administrative work to do after importing users into TRACK to make sure each user had the correct Area ID and had a temporary password when needed. Now, they will be able to make those specifications inside of the import itself cutting back on extra administrative work.</p>

                <p><em>A Former Maintenance Manager with over 40 years of industrial maintenance experience, shares how the TRACK Platform helped improve his maintenance budget performance and daily management of contractors.</em></p>
                <!--more-->
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">We spoke with Bruce Grissom, a former Maintenance Manager with over 40 years of maintenance experience at multiple oil &amp; gas refineries, about his experience utilizing the TRACK Platform for his maintenance programs. He explained how using <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TRACK</a> allowed him to improve his budget performance, ensure contracts were being adhered to, manage the crew ratios of his contractors on-site, and eliminate spend leakage.&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 style="font-size: 24px;"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">How did TRACK help to improve your budget performance?</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></h3>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>Bruce</strong>: If I go back about 8-</span><span data-contrast="auto">10 years in my career,&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">it’s</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;like everyone else</span><span data-contrast="auto">.&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">I’m pretty sure it</span><span data-contrast="auto">’</span><span data-contrast="auto">s common across the industry, but the budgets were getting tighter and tighter. Every year I was asked to reduce my maintenance budget</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;and</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;spend</span><span data-contrast="auto">.&nbsp;S</span><span data-contrast="auto">o I did like many others did; I went after productivity. If I could get more productivity, I could then squeeze more work out of the budget I had, and then I could reduce the headcount because I could get more work completed. That was kind of the traditional way of going after getting more out of your budget.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Then, I went after the next thing I learned from my peers in the industry which was if you have a robust workflow process, you can then also squeeze some additional work out of your existing contractor workforce. This then allows you to look at reducing headcount again because the bottom line is for me to control my spend</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">I</span><span data-contrast="auto">t was all about the number of contractors I had onsite in the facility. In the facility I was at, I averaged on any given day about 500 contract workforce that I was responsible&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">for&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">day in and day out. That did not include</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">turnarounds. During turnarounds, we’d peak at about 2500. I used it&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">every day</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;of the year to get the most out of my budget that I could. </span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">To give you an example, I took a 31% productivity rate</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;and</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;got up to about 50%. I took a workflow process from zero, developed it,</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;and</span><span data-contrast="auto"> got that as strong as I could. I still needed to be able to get more work done. I was still being asked to reduce my budget.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">So,</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;I was in a room one da</span><span data-contrast="auto">y, and </span><span data-contrast="auto">TRACK was coming into a facility to run a turnaround</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;I saw what they did for that <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/shutdown-turnaround-outage" rel="noopener" target="_blank">turnaround</a>, and I said, “you know, I could do this on my side, too.”&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">So,</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;I went after TRACK</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> I put TRACK in for the routine day-to-day business. I then felt comfortable that I was getting every moment of work I could get from the contracted workforce that I had onsite</span><span data-contrast="auto">. As a result, I was able to continue to reduce my budget overall. Certainly, I was being asked to do that by senior management, but every year I was able to hit my reduction targets, even with inflation going up. I could not have done that without TRACK helping me manage and only pay what I owe the vendors. And you’ll see the realization was we were&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">overpaying</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;our vendors a considerable amount.&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">T</span><span data-contrast="auto">hat’s how I went after improving my overall budget&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">performance and <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/maintenance" rel="noopener" target="_blank">maintenance</a> in&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">an</span><span data-contrast="auto"> environment where we were constantly reducing. And we’re constantly reducing today given what’s happening in the oil industry.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 24px;"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">What were the biggest benefits that TRACK brought to your maintenance programs?</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></h3>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>Bruce:</strong> I</span><span data-contrast="auto">t was amazing the deeper I dove into this</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;to see and u</span><span data-contrast="auto">nderstand how little my team&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">understood</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">about&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">what was in the contract that purchasing had put together</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">M</span><span data-contrast="auto">y supervisor was signing timesheets that were going into a manual process and being approved had no clue as to what </span><span data-contrast="auto">a consumable item was</span><span data-contrast="auto">. They had no clue how many pieces of equipment that vendor, trucks, welding machines, that kind of thing that was in the contract; they didn’t know any of the details that were in the contract. And it was amazing, once we got into TRACK, how little I realized that they knew. </span><span data-contrast="auto">W</span><span data-contrast="auto">ith TRACK, it allowed me to take that burden&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">off</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;the people that were in the field whose focus was executing work. Their job was to get the work done, make sure it was done safely, and then make sure it was done efficiently based on the information I shared with you earlier about the workflow and time on tools.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">W</span><span data-contrast="auto">hat TRACK did is offload all of the responsibilities from the field personnel, because they felt confident and I felt confident that all of the terms and conditions that were in the contract, in the PO’s, were being applied automatically when TRACK was in place. I als</span><span data-contrast="auto">o paired with our purchasing group at this point once I realized just how little control I had pre-TRACK. We partnered up to tighten up the </span><span data-contrast="auto">contractual terms even tighter which then translated into more controls from the TRACK side allowing my budget to go even further.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 style="font-size: 24px;"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">How did the data from TRACK help you proactively manage maintenance activities and your contractors?</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></h3>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>Bruce:</strong> A few things helped me tremendously. One was skills. </span><span data-contrast="auto">O</span><span data-contrast="auto">n the Gulf Coast, we were always challenged to find</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">skilled craftspeople. The vendors were challenged to provide skilled craftspeople. I remember sitting down on more than one occasion and negotiating the ratio between first-class </span><span data-contrast="auto">(</span><span data-contrast="auto">or journeymen-type level</span><span data-contrast="auto">)</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;and helper class.&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">P</span><span data-contrast="auto">re-TRACK, I couldn’t see that. I had to depend on what the vendor was telling me was the skillset of that individual, and it was a constant battle. At least on the Gulf Coast, </span><span data-contrast="auto">the group of people with that skill set was getting smaller and smaller</span><span data-contrast="auto">.&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">With</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;TRACK</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;I could now look at the skills every</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">day, and I could put some flags when the skill level 1 versus the skill level 4 ratio began to get out of proportion.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;I could sit down with the vendors and say, “you agreed to this particular ratio</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">T</span><span data-contrast="auto">hat’s how I g</span><span data-contrast="auto">o</span><span data-contrast="auto">t the most productivity, which helped me tremendously along that side</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">The other thing was what I found out also pre-TRACK&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">was</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">at the beginning the relationship my supervisors had with the vendors&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">was just too close. Too much of a buddy-buddy type environment.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;Too often I would have supervisors approving people to go out to the parking lot and get tools, for example</span><span data-contrast="auto">, or leave early to go pick up lunch or run errands that were not in the contract.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;So&nbsp;with TRACK, I would always look at this thing we call Overrides.&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Anything that conflicts with the terms and conditions within the contract, comes through the system via an&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">O</span><span data-contrast="auto">verr</span><span data-contrast="auto">ide. Well, I would look at the Overrides, who was approving them, and what were their reasons for those approvals</span><span data-contrast="auto">. It allowed me to sit down and coach my staff and make them</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;more aware of what they were doing when&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">they approved. I was able </span><span data-contrast="auto">to basically drive those&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">O</span><span data-contrast="auto">verrides to a low number. They never go away because the vendors are constantly submitting</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;for things that are not covered under the contract.&nbsp;So&nbsp;we constantly coached and trained our guys&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">to limit those O</span><span data-contrast="auto">verrides</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">W</span><span data-contrast="auto">hen the&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">O</span><span data-contrast="auto">verride comes in, you must know as a field approver that&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">the&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">O</span><span data-contrast="auto">verride is legitimate.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">So, it helped me train my guys on why and how often those were coming through</span><span data-contrast="auto">. And those were kind of the three big areas for me. The big difference once TRACK was implemented.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"></span></p>

                <![CDATA[<p><em><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/December%20Release%20Blog%20Image.jpg" width="674" style="width: 674px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" alt="TRACK Platform Contractor Management Software Release"></em><em>Management Controls, Inc. launches new software release in December that brings the new revokes feature as well as other features to improve user efficiency within the TRACK Platform.</em></p>
                <p><!--more--><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">MCi is continuously looking for ways to use the <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TRACK Platform</a> to solve daily pain points for our users.&nbsp; This month we are adding new features to improve user efficiency within TRACK. The most notable is our revokes feature but we have also enhanced email alerts for pending authorizations, added a qualified skill import, and more!</span><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"></span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/revokes%20image.png" alt="Revokes Wizsrd" width="5334" style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Roboto; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 5334px;"><br><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"></span></h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The TRACK Platform’s previous voiding capabilities did not allow users to make edits, corrections, or process credits to individually authorized item(s) without affecting the entire timesheet. With this release, the Revoke Wizard enables Track Coordinators to revoke individual allocations within a timesheet so that individual lines can be corrected to submit credit payments through the TRACK system to bring the systems in sync. Revokes leverage negative allocations to enable corrections without voiding a timesheet. This will cut down on potential extra manual labor that could slow down the daily settlement process. If the SAP or Web Services APIs are in use, configurations will need to be updated to enable negative services entries or to post credit memos. This will need to be done before the Revoke Wizard can be fully utilized.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4><span style="color: #58595b;">Frequently Asked Questions about Revokes:</span></h4>
                <p><strong>Will these negative allocation lines show up report inquiries?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes, they do show up on report inquiries. There are also two specific reports that are focused on revokes.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Can Vendor timekeepers have the ability to revoke?</strong></p>
                <p>The revokes functionality is based on permissions. To ensure that there is clear communication between the Vendor and the Track Coordinator, we recommend the Track Coordinator perform the revokes. However, if a owner wants the vendor to have permission to revoke, that can be accommodated.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>What happens to the timesheet when specific allocation(s) have been revoked?</strong></p>
                <p>The timesheet will still exist and remain unchanged. A new timesheet is created for the revoke allocation and the new allocation.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>How do revokes post in SAP?</strong></p>
                <p>If you are using our SAP integration, please work with our team to leverage the updated integration necessary to accommodate the revoke feature. The revoke will be shown as a negative timesheet (negative service entry sheet or invoice number) the positive and negative timesheets will be sent separately.&nbsp;Please submit a support ticket to discuss the updated integration necessary.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Would you still have capabilities to void timesheets like the past, or do we need to use the revoke wizard?</strong></p>
                <p>The voiding capabilities still exist and will be maintained. The revokes wizard is an alternative solution for customers who do not want to void entire timesheets, but want to revoke specific allocations.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/pending%20authorization%20alerts.png" alt="Pending Authorization Alerts" width="5334" style="width: 5334px;"></h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Contractors may send charges to Authorizers from previous work dates but without an alert these can get left behind for review and authorization. With this release, TRACK now enables Pending Authorizations email notifications to notify users of pending authorizations regardless of work date.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/skill%20qualification%20import.png" alt="Skill Qualification Imports" width="5334" style="width: 5334px;"></h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The manual application of skill qualifications is a manual task that was not optimized for large amounts of data being loaded at once. TRACK provides the option to leverage an import to manage skill qualifications making processing easier and efficient.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/TRACK%20U-100.jpg" alt="What's new in TRACK University" width="1280" style="width: 1280px;"></h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><!--more--></p>
                <p>In April of 2020, Management Controls launched TRACK University, an eLearning platform that serves as a distance learning tool for all MCi’s SaaS products. We met with Valetta Taylor, Manager of Training at MCi, to discuss TRACK University and what is coming in 2021.</p>
                <div><br>
                <p><strong>What is TRACK University and who is it for?</strong></p>
                <div><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track-university" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TRACK University</a> is a learning management system for current and new customers of the <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TRACK Platform</a>. <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/our-customers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Our current customers</a> can learn more about TRACK <span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">functionality while staying informed regarding software updates and releases.</span> New customers can use TRACK University to learn how to use the application by utilizing the videos, quick reference guides, and tests to develop and improve their TRACK Platform knowledge. All customers can use it to acquire a Certification for a particular Persona in TRACK.</div>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/TRACK%20U%20mock%20up%202.png" alt="TRACK U mock up 2" width="526" style="width: 526px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
                <p><strong>What is offered in TRACK University? </strong></p>
                <p>Currently, TRACK University offers courses that breakdown content about the different functionality that exists inside of the TRACK application by using videos and quick reference guides. We offer courses as well as a combination of courses that we refer to as Learning Plans to help our Users become Super Users inside of the TRACK application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <div>&nbsp;</div>
                <p><strong>Who is using TRACK University (Roles)?</strong></p>
                <p>All of the roles inside of the TRACK application would find TRACK University to be a useful tool. This includes Vendor Timekeepers, Track Coordinators, Authorizers or Approvers as well as information for Procurement Managers. I've had several Infrastructure Managers reach out to me and enroll in the Track Admin application to better understand the security and setup of TRACK. I think it's fair to say if you are using the TRACK application, we have something in TRACK University to help you understand it better.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>What is the difference between a Learning Plan, a Course, and a Certification?</strong></p>
                <p>A Course is simply a single instructional lesson regarding how to use a particular function inside of the TRACK application. A Learning Plan is a combination of courses designed to improve the role of a specific user inside of the application. For example, we have a Learning Plan for Track Coordinators, Vendor Timekeepers, Track Authorizers, and recently a Learning Plan for Procurement Managers.</p>
                <p>Users receive a customized certificate for completing an individual Course, Learning Plan, or Certification. Badges are also given to users for how many Courses, Learning Plans, and Certifications they have completed. Another feature is a Leaderboard within TRACK University so users can see where they rank in the amount of courses they have completed. Certificates, badges, and the Leaderboard are all designed to add gamification to TRACK University and add a layer of fun and competition to completing more Courses.</p>
                <p><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Course%20Completion%20Certification%20EXAMPLE.jpg" alt="Course Completion Certification EXAMPLE" width="673" style="width: 673px;"></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>How many users are enrolled in TRACK University?</strong></p>
                <p>We currently have over 1600 users inside of TRACK University. On average, 15 to 20 people submit a request for access to TRACK University on a weekly basis.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>How many users have been TRACK certified?</strong></p>
                <div>Currently less than 1% of users in TRACK University have certifications. We plan to launch a certification campaign in 2021 to increase the certifications inside of TRACK University. Those certifications will be for Track Coordinators, Vendor Timekeepers, and Track Authorizers.</div>

                <p><strong>What would you say are the biggest benefits of TRACK University?</strong></p>
                <p>I would say there are three main benefits to TRACK University:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>You can find the information needed to perform your job within a matter of minutes anytime, anywhere.</li>
                <li>When MCi releases software updates to the TRACK Platform, TRACK University has courses specific to the changes that are happening with that release within days of the changes going live on the TRACK Platform. All of the courses related to a software release are grouped together in one Learning Plan.</li>
                <li>This tool allows a user to engage in their own personal development and improve their skills on their own time, at their own pace.</li>
                </ol>

                <![CDATA[<p><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Mining%20Image_.png" alt="Mining Image_" width="1000" style="width: 1000px;"></p>
                <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has slowed global economies and upended energy and commodity markets with its unprecedented effects on workforce management and supply chain disruption. The mining industry, while strongly positioned heading into 2020, has not been immune to the economic downturn. Mining companies worldwide have had to adapt to major challenges such as lockdowns ceasing mining work, physical distancing slowing down progress on projects, and segments of its workforce having to keep track of operations remotely, leading to a long backlog of activity.&nbsp;</p>
                <!--more-->
                <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                <h3>Managing Contractor Spend in a Down Economy</h3>
                <p>As uncertainty continues, companies must remain agile and develop strategies that aren’t just reactive, but proactive. Improving efficiency doesn’t have to mean massive budget cuts or workforce losses—it can be an opportunity to introduce digital solutions that keep companies running leaner and more profitably. With contractor spend and all its associated costs at the heart of mining operations, it’s critical that companies strategize on how to better control those costs in the current economy.</p>
                <p>Consider these four strategies to better control mining contractor service costs and help your company work smarter through the economic downturn:</p>
                <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
                <h4>1. Better budget management&nbsp;</h4>
                <p>A recent survey we conducted across 140 mining companies of all sizes showed that 60% of them reported projects being behind schedule and over budget. Capital discipline is especially crucial in a slow economy, so having clarity around every cost for labor, equipment, and materials is a necessity.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>With the right software, you can track every expense and stay on target—relying on spreadsheets or manual entry when every penny counts is a gamble you can’t afford. By eliminating timesheet errors,<span style="color: #0600ff;"><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/industries-and-overbilling" rel="noopener" style="color: #0600ff;"> incorrect invoices and overbilling</a></span> while ensuring compliance with terms and agreements, your mining operations can save as much as 10% to 15% in annual spend.&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
                <h4>2. More workforce visibility</h4>
                <p>When you can truly see the progress that’s being made day by day, it’s easier to balance expenses. Ensuring you have the right mix of skills on a project can avoid costly delays, while <span style="color: #0600ff;"><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/insights" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color: #0600ff;">real-time metrics</a></span> will show you the exact hours it takes to manage a project.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>By investing in a<span style="color: #0600ff;"> <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" style="color: #0600ff;">contractor management solution</a></span> that offers real-time personnel and equipment information, you’ll gain efficiency while minimizing cost and eliminating any surprises that might pop up along the way. With a view into actual production, you can monitor mining operations exactly as they progress, from start to finish, keeping contractors accountable and minimizing disputes.&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
                <h4>3. Optimized wrench time</h4>
                <p>Wrench time is simple productivity—and not having eyes on the mine site can mean unanticipated delays that require overtime hours to stick to the schedule. A recent report by a national contractor suggests that only 29% of the standard workday is spent on actual work, while the rest is divided up among work rules, travel, instruction, idle time, and more. Imagine if you could double that to nearly 60% and immediately decrease overtime by double digits, saving tens of millions of dollars. That’s true optimization. And it’s achievable with automated reporting that keeps the company and contractor on the same page.</p>
                <p>Through daily contractor agreements and with full transparency, there’s less room for idle time, missing permits or materials, late inspections, or disputed timesheets. These common problems are products of a less streamlined era and its manual processes, and digital solutions can put documentation, time tracking, and productivity metrics front and center every day.</p>
                <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
                <h4>4. The right contractor management software</h4>
                <p>The software market can be an overwhelming space, but the <span style="color: #0600ff;"><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" style="color: #0600ff;">TRACK® Platform</a></span> is uniquely positioned to benefit mining companies and their operations. Using real-time data, automated tracking, and integrated contract compliance, TRACK gives unprecedented visibility into your workforce, productivity, and spending through a comprehensive set of capabilities, including:</p>

It also enables contractors to use the same data for internal systems, so everyone is working with the same data.</span></li>
                <li style="border: none;"><span style="color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.7);">Enabling service entries staged for payment to contractors through the ERP system once authorized allocations are received.</span></li>

                <h3>Digitizing Your Response to Economic Downturn</h3>
                <p>Each mined commodity is affected differently by the economic downturn, but all can be managed more efficiently. For those hit especially hard by the energy market’s volatility and the supply and demand rebalance that follows, finding an effective contractor management solution is critical—enabling data-based decision-making that can improve efficiency and profitability by millions of dollars every year.</p>

                <p><em>Management Controls, Inc. launches new features to TRACK Anywhere product suite of mobile applications.</em></p>
                <!--more-->
                <p>Management Controls Inc. is continually looking for ways to improve our software to meet the needs of our customers. We have recently launched an update to TRACK Anywhere that benefits both products, Virtual Gate and Kiosk. We want <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track-anywhere" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TRACK Anywhere</a> to continue to be a helpful tool for customers to monitor and manage remote workforces.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><strong>Access Codes For Kiosk</strong></h3>
                <p>Companies can now assign each worker with a unique access code in lieu of RFID badges or QR codes. Workers can use this access code to badge in or out by typing it on the TRACK Anywhere Kiosk. Additionally, if a worker forgets or misplaces their RFID badge or QR code, they are able to use their unique access code as a backup. This cuts back on the need for companies to manage and distribute RFID badges and QR codes. Access codes are both easy to create and manage, and will give companies the flexibility to pick the most efficient option for their specific needs.</p>

                <p><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Kiosk%20Mock-up-02.png" alt="Kiosk Mock-up-02" width="300" style="width: 300px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;"></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                <h3>Flexible Crews For Virtual Gate</h3>
                <p>Each of our customers manage their remote worksites differently and have different needs to meet. Because of this, we have added more flexibility to TRACK Anywhere Virtual Gate. Depending on the actual project and jobs that need to be done each day, there are times when a foreman may need to pull a worker from a different crew or organization, or times when a crew is not needed, and a resource needs to operate as an individual worker. Virtual Gate now allows foremen to easily edit their crew mix and add workers from other crews as well as make someone an individual worker without a crew. Additionally, Virtual Gate now has the option to easily turn both the badge in/out and field note capabilities on and off.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Additional Updates</h3>
                <p>Our customers currently have applications to manage their workforce including Profile Manager, Management Console, <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TRACK</a>, and possibly an access control system. We now offer the ability to consolidate all of the administration work into one application, Management Console. Consolidating into one application will potentially cut back on the amount of administration tasks needed and is intended to make the process more efficient.</p>]]>

                <p id="bdbf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Sourcing and Procurement professionals live in the Source-to-Pay process each day to create value for their organizations and the overall value stream in which they work. Whether you’re new to the Sourcing and Procurement world or you’ve been in the profession for years, I’m glad you’re here for the journey of Mastering the Source-to-Pay Process.</p>
                <p id="1c96" data-selectable-paragraph="">During this mastery journey, we will discuss key sub-processes within the overall Source-to-Pay Process for goods and services. This journey will focus on the pain points experienced and how to shift them into gains for you and your organization.</p>
                <p id="6209" data-selectable-paragraph="">Before<span id="rmm"><span>&nbsp;</span></span>we get into the sub-processes, let’s start with the high-level view of Supply Chain Management.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h2 id="1f1a" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Supply Chain Management</strong></h2>
                <p id="7138" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Supply Chain involves Operations, Sourcing and Procurement, Manufacturing, Inventory Management, Distributors, Warehouses, Logistics, Retailers, Suppliers, and other pieces of the larger puzzle that enables the creation of value and improves the long-term performance of enterprises and the supply chain as a whole.</p>
                <p id="67e0" data-selectable-paragraph="">The goal of Supply Chain Management is to maximize value creation as it moves product or services from their origins of supply to their point of final consumption while driving innovation, transformation, continued improvement, integration, and collaboration.</p>
                <p id="a31c" data-selectable-paragraph="">The larger context of Supply Chain Management drive the perspective that each of these key business functions must work together to achieve goals with a focus towards value creation from the source all the way end customer or consumer.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h2 id="d01e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Source-to-Pay Process</h2>
                <p id="44ce" data-selectable-paragraph=""><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/a-road-map-for-digitizing-source-to-pay#" rel="noopener nofollow">McKinsey<span>&nbsp;</span></a>defines the Source-to-Pay process as “the end-to-end value stream that encompasses all the activities required for an organization to obtain and pay for goods and services from other entities.”</p>
                <p id="6746" data-selectable-paragraph="">This process is segmented into four main sub-processes:</p>
                <ul>
                <li id="64d3" data-selectable-paragraph="">Source to Contract: This process is key in finding sources of supply for goods and services that are needed by the organization, selecting the right supplier to achieve desired goals, and leveraging the right contracting strategy to achieve a win-win outcome.</li>
                <li id="b28b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Procure to Invoice: This process takes the executed contract and starts with a purchase requisition, generating a purchase order for the scope required, and receiving the scope of that purchase order.</li>
                <li id="777d" data-selectable-paragraph="">Invoice to Pay: This process starts with receiving an invoicing from suppliers, getting the necessary approvals, and processing the payment according to payment terms.</li>
                <li id="9ed8" data-selectable-paragraph="">Supplier Management: This process focuses on a win-win relationship between customer and supplier to maximize return on investment (ROI) and minimize risk in the supply chain.</li>
                </ul>
                <p id="311d" data-selectable-paragraph="">In future articles, we will be looking at these key processes within the Source-to-Pay Process, their pain points, and how to address them to drive to increased value creation for your organization and the supply chain as a whole.</p>

                <p><span>In Part 2 of the procurement series, Anna Van Cleef discusses a high level view of the Source-to-Contract process and the best practices for procurement professionals.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><!--more-->As mentioned in <a href="/source-to-pay-how-to-master-the-process-part-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">part 1</a> of this series, the Source-to-Contract process is key in finding sources of supply for goods and/or services that are needed by the organization, selecting the right supplier to achieve those desired goals, and leveraging the right contracting strategy to achieve a win-win outcome.<span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Roboto Condensed'; font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px;"></span></p>
                <h2><span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: 'Roboto Condensed'; font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px;">Finding sources of supply for goods and/or services that are needed by the organization</span></h2>
                <section>
                <p id="553a" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once a decision is made to procure goods and/or serv<span id="rmm">i</span>ces based on a need, Sourcing and Procurement must find suppliers to achieve the organization’s goals. Sourcing and Procurement professionals have access to multiple resources to get started on defining an initial list. Some of these resources include: incumbent suppliers, trade associations, trade press, exhibitions, business advisors, directories, recommendations, government approved lists, competitors in the market, and other sources in which your organization has access.</p>
                <h3 id="5a2f" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 24px;">Pain Points:</h3>
                <ul>
                <li id="69e3" data-selectable-paragraph="">When sourcing new categories, it can be time consuming to find and organize a sufficient list of potential sources of supply.</li>
                <li id="7842" data-selectable-paragraph="">When contracts are up for renewal, it can be challenging to deviate from an embedded, incumbent supplier.</li>
                <li id="1c4c" data-selectable-paragraph="">When Field Personnel have built a relationship with a local supplier, change management can be difficult when bringing in a corporate contract.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="9436" style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Recommendations</strong>:</h3>
                <ul>
                <li id="5e94" data-selectable-paragraph="">Clearly understand the needs and goals for your organization. This can help find suppliers that are tailored to meet those needs.</li>
                <li id="0579" data-selectable-paragraph="">Leverage multiple sources to gather a list of potential suppliers.</li>
                <li id="20bf" data-selectable-paragraph="">If you have an incumbent supplier, ask them who they would list as their competition.</li>
                <li id="76bd" data-selectable-paragraph="">Work early to find key points that can assist with a change in source of supply related to your company’s Management of Change (MOC) and Organizational Change Management (OCM) processes. These are key processes that will make communication and change more effective and long-lasting.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="1abb">Selecting the right supplier to achieve desired goals</h2>
                <p id="170f" data-selectable-paragraph="">After compiling a list of potential suppliers, the process of selecting the right supplier begins. Oftentimes, the first step is to gather additional details about each supplier to assist in the decision making process. Key information can be sourced from online research, recommendations, or through a Request for Information (RFI).</p>
                <p id="65a9" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once information about the suppliers has been gathered, there are a number of ways to refine the list of suppliers to make the final decision. Today, we will go just a little further into two such methods: Three Bids and a Buy and Supplier Scorecards.</p>
                <h3 id="683b" style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Three Bids and a Buy</strong></h3>
                <p id="fa04" data-selectable-paragraph="">This informal procurement method allows Sourcing and Procurement professionals to find three potential sources of supply, often one being the incumbent supplier, and determine based on the limited options, which is the best source of supply.</p>
                <p id="cfc5" data-selectable-paragraph="">This method is often used when trying to find the low cost provider in a category with lower risk or overall spend.</p>
                <h3 id="dc87" style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Supplier Scorecards</strong></h3>
                <p id="6721" data-selectable-paragraph="">When evaluating higher spend, new, or higher risk categories, the Supplier Scorecard method provides a more complete picture during the supplier selection process. Based on the aligned sourcing and procurement strategy, selection criteria for the supplier scorecard should be defined.</p>
                <p id="43a2" data-selectable-paragraph="">Criteria for a supplier scorecard can fall into many categories. Some of these include: price, quality, on-time delivery, financial stability, long-term potential for partnership, reliability, alignment to company philosophy, geographic support, transportation, travel costs, etc.</p>
                <p id="2272" data-selectable-paragraph="">Leveraging your aligned selection criteria and the responses from the RFI and other types of requests, the Scorecard can be completed. Each criteria should have a weighting that aligns to the value that that criteria has toward enabling the goal for the organization.</p>
                <p id="7522" data-selectable-paragraph="">Limit the potential suppliers to between 3 and 10 by identifying which suppliers do not meet the minimum criteria and remove them from the process. With the final list of suppliers, include other evaluators from within the organization to score each criteria. Additional sessions with these suppliers may be necessary to further clarify answers from the RFI and other requests that can drive the evaluation process.</p>
                <p id="b14d" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once clarifications have been made, the evaluators should input their scores for each of the remaining suppliers. Based on a weighted average, the supplier to select to achieve the goals of the organization should have the highest score.</p>
                <h3 id="e541" style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Pain Points:</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                <li id="0abb" data-selectable-paragraph="">RFI’s take too much time.</li>
                <li id="f5a1" data-selectable-paragraph="">Completing the scorecard pulls resources away from the other critical work.</li>
                <li id="4cce" data-selectable-paragraph="">The current pandemic has put further constraints on our resources. The additional time to do these processes doesn’t feel worth it when we have incumbent suppliers in other categories that can perform the job.</li>
                <li id="24f6" data-selectable-paragraph="">The time committed to these activities feels like they would have a high opportunity cost for my categories.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="b0d4" style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Recommendations:</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                <li id="a7a9" data-selectable-paragraph="">Leverage digital methods to streamlining your RFI and data gathering process. Solutions, such as<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.ariba.com/" rel="noopener nofollow">Ariba</a>, can help to make this process easier on Sourcing and Procurement Professionals.</li>
                <li id="7839" data-selectable-paragraph="">Apply the right method of selection based on the strategy for that category or need. Not all sourcing events should use the same method.</li>
                <li id="06d6" data-selectable-paragraph="">When strategic, new, or high risk sourcing needs arise, the additional investment in time upfront can reduce frustration, quality gaps, and misalignment on the backend.</li>
                <li id="18c6" data-selectable-paragraph="">It is always wise to know which backup suppliers would be selected in the event the first choice may not be realized.</li>
                <li id="423d" data-selectable-paragraph="">Price is not always the highest weighted criteria. Ensure your criteria aligns with organization and project goals.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="1919">Leveraging the right contracting strategy to achieve a win-win outcome</h2>
                <p id="57e3" data-selectable-paragraph="">So now that you have the supplier, and one or more backup options, make sure you apply the right contracting strategy to achieve a win-win outcome for both organizations.</p>
                <h3 id="81f2" style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Understand Strategy</strong></h3>
                <p id="107d" data-selectable-paragraph="">Go back to the original goals of the organization regarding this sourcing or procurement event. Is this a strategic contract or is it transactional in nature? How do the organizations align on<a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_08.htm" rel="noopener nofollow"><span>&nbsp;</span>Porter’s Five Forces</a>? Based on these and other details, ensure everyone on the team understands the strategy before the negotiation.</p>
                <h3 id="e476" style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Negotiate</strong></h3>
                <p id="829f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Often, negotiations start with an initial quote. This quote typically comes from a Request for Quote (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RFP). This gives the organization a baseline understanding of where the supplier stands on key cost factors. This information may also have been used during the selection process.</p>
                <p id="cc59" data-selectable-paragraph="">Before beginning a negotiation, know your organization’s position on each negotiation point. Where is your organization able to compromise? What are deal breakers for your organization that would cause the deal to dissolve? What are the necessary outcomes for your organization to drive toward value creation and a win-win for both sides? The goal of negotiations should not be a “win-lose” approach where one organization plays “hard-ball” on all areas within the negotiation. This doesn’t lend toward long-term partnership and causes strain during the life of the contract. Drive toward the “win-win” where both organizations are able to achieve what is important to them or reach an appropriate compromise creating value for the supply chain as a whole.</p>
                <h3 id="6ea8"><strong>Contract Drafts and Execution</strong></h3>
                <p id="640d" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once negotiations have concluded and a win-win outcome has been achieved, it is time to put everything on paper. This consists of draft contracts between both parties seeking legal review and alignment until both parties agree and the contract is executed. Communication of the contractual terms and conditions to impacted stakeholders is important to ensure that the terms of the contract are upheld.</p>
                <h3 id="a6bf" style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Pain Points:</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                <li id="b07f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Negotiations are intimidating.</li>
                <li id="3fd6" data-selectable-paragraph="">I’m not sure what my company values outside of having the “lowest cost” source of supply.</li>
                <li id="fff0" data-selectable-paragraph="">Getting to an executed contract takes so long with the number of revisions required.</li>
                <li id="8744" data-selectable-paragraph="">Executed contracts for services aren’t understood by stakeholders in the field. Audit has a field day when reviewing what has actually been paid out.</li>
                <li id="2445" data-selectable-paragraph="">Handshake deals override what our contracts say and causes us to not meet contractual goals.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="b90c" style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Recommendations:</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                <li id="33b7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Invest in negotiations training for your sourcing and procurement professionals that drives toward win-win outcomes.</li>
                <li id="3e48" data-selectable-paragraph="">Work with the stakeholders of the sourcing or procurement event to understand their needs up front. If quality is of the utmost importance, then that should be considered or weighted higher.</li>
                <li id="595c" data-selectable-paragraph="">Work with sourcing and procurement leadership within your organization to understand the company’s goals and objectives for the project or event. Also seek to understand the company’s goals as a whole.</li>
                <li id="5933" data-selectable-paragraph="">During negotiation, be sure to document what was agreed. Leverage a note taker and provide an overview of each negotiated area before ending the session. This can reduce rework and frustration during the contract drafting process.</li>
                <li id="8da0" data-selectable-paragraph="">Leverage a Supplier Management System that systematically applies contractual terms and conditions to reduce contract leakage. One such system,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener nofollow">Track</a>, can help to reduce contract leakage by 10%.</li>
                <li id="f37b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Communicate the value of strategic partners to the field and the service levels that they can expect.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><em>Management Controls releases State of Contractor Management in Mining, magnifying the need for Industry Digital Transformation.</em></p>
                </div>
                <!--more-->
                <p>Cloud-based contractor management platform, Management Controls Inc. (MCi), released the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://info.managementcontrols.com/state-of-contractor-management-mining-whitepaper" onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow">State of Contractor Management in the Mining Industry</a>, uncovering the highs and lows of mining contractor management in today’s environment.</p>
                <p>The company conducted a survey designed to identify key pain points around managing mining contractors and contractor spend. Originally hoping for 50 respondents to chime in, MCi far exceeded its goal with top executives from 140 mining companies sharing firsthand insights.</p>
                <p>“Our ultimate goal is to improve relationships between owners and contractors. Mining operations, as you can imagine, are robust, complex, and dynamic. That’s why insight is extremely valuable to us. More than just identifying pain points, we want to dig deeper into the differences between perceived challenges in the industry and solutions at hand,” explained Mr. Ken Naughton, President of Management Controls Inc.</p>
                <p>The report sheds a light on opportunities for improving operational efficiencies as well as growing contractor trends in the mining industry. Almost half (45%) of the companies who participated in the survey manage 100 or more onsite contractors and around 23.5% planned on spending $50 million or more at just one site. A glaring majority of the survey participants acknowledged their use of manual spreadsheets to track vital information such as productivity, timelines, and budgets. Perhaps tellingly, the report also revealed high occurrences of project delays and overspending.</p>
                <p>Asked about the main takeaways Mr. Naughton said, “With 40% of a mine’s operation cost attributed to the use of contractors, it is mind boggling that such a large amount of spend and complexity is still being managed by spreadsheets or not being managed at all.”</p>
                <p>“Powerful digital tools like our TRACK® Platform can help mining companies stay productive and profitable. Now more than ever, mining companies need a way to facilitate better communication between owners and contractors, a means of optimizing manual processes, and transparency when it comes to allocation of resources and expenses,” he continued.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow">TRACK®</a><span>&nbsp;</span>is a digital contractor management platform with real-time visibility into daily operations and built-in contract compliance developed by Management Controls Inc. to help businesses streamline processes, increase productivity, and reduce cost. Mining companies already utilizing TRACK® achieved up to 10-15% in annual savings while tightening controls over labor, equipment, and materials spending across the board.<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Download and read the full report by clicking below.</span></p>

                <div>
                <p id="3dc9" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Procure-to-Invoice process leverages the executed contract to generate a purchase requisition and/or purchase order for the scope required, receives the scope of that purchase order, and receive an invoice from the supplier for the goods or services procured.</p>
                <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2 id="4ab8">Generate a purchase requisition and/or purchase order for the scope required</h2>
                <p id="2154" data-selectable-paragraph="">Companies differ in their process to issue to a Purchase Order (PO). Some require the creation of a Purchase Requisition (PR) over a certain dollar threshold to support an audit trail while other companies go straight to a PO.</p>
                <p id="ab16" data-selectable-paragraph="">Regardless, a Purchase<span id="rmm"><span>&nbsp;</span></span>Requisition is typically initiated by a requisitioner within the business for needed goods or services and begins the formal request for procurement. While this document is utilized for supporting the organization’s needs, it is an internal document and is not legally binding between the parties in the supply chain.</p>
                <p id="d39d" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Purchase Order is issued to a seller and describes the types, quantities, and agreed prices of the goods and/or services being requested. Once accepted by the seller, the PO becomes a contractual obligation between the buyer and the seller.</p>
                <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
                <h2 id="3f56">Receives the scope of that purchase order</h2>
                <p id="bbe2" data-selectable-paragraph="">The receipt of goods and services look different in the Procure-to-Invoice process. A seller will leverage the details of the Purchase Order to deliver goods and services. Let’s look at the similarities and differences between Goods and Services.</p>
                <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                <h3 id="2f22"><strong>Goods:</strong></h3>
                <p id="ebcc" data-selectable-paragraph="">A seller will collect the goods required to meet the Purchase Order details and prepare them to be shipped to the buyer. The seller will typically work with logistics companies to deliver the goods to the seller based on an agreed timeline.</p>
                <p id="fafc" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once the goods arrive at the buyer’s warehouse or defined location, employees should see a few documents before accepting the shipment:</p>
                <ol>
                <li id="b00d" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Bill of Lading</em>: This document is issued by the shipper as agreement acknowledging the receipt of the goods for shipment. This document acts as a proof of ownership on international shipments and is used as a shipment receipt once it arrives at its destination.</li>
                <li id="2959" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Packing List:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>This document defines the list of goods that are included in the shipment and provides key details such as good type, quantity, and other details based on the method of shipment.</li>
                <li id="f976" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Commercial Invoice:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this document includes complete details of the sales transaction and is used in international shipments for clearance through Customs.</li>
                </ol>
                <p id="b906" data-selectable-paragraph="">Other documents, such as a certificate of origin, may also be required based on the origin/destination and method of shipment.</p>
                <p id="49a1" data-selectable-paragraph="">Employees from the buying organization will perform a count of the goods received and validate that it meets the required levels of quality and specification before accepting the good from the shipper. If everything checks out, the goods are received and a Goods Receipt is issued. Typically performed electronically, a Goods Receipt is a document that serves as a confirmation that the goods were received to the warehouse or location of delivery.</p>
                <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                <h3 id="8a3a"><strong>Services:</strong></h3>
                <p id="3a06" data-selectable-paragraph="">A supplier will work with the buyer to schedule the services based on the Statement of Work (SOW) and Purchase Order. The purchase of services can last months and even years and are often billed monthly or weekly based on the terms in the contractual agreement, SOW, or PO.</p>
                <p id="c72d" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once the work begins, Timesheets are used as documentation showing various Labor, Equipment, and Material resources used each day on the job. Timesheets can be either paper or electronic and often require the signature of the buyer’s employee overseeing the work to validate that resources were present.</p>
                <p id="7657" data-selectable-paragraph="">Validating that resources were present for the job can be challenging when comparing those times to the Timesheet presented by the supplier. Leveraging information from a Proof of Presence or Access Control System can help in the validation that labor resources were present during the hours communicated on the timesheet. The timesheet acts as the receipt of services during the invoicing process.</p>
                <p id="5a7d" data-selectable-paragraph="">Before we get to the invoicing process, let’s take the concept of validation one step further. Organizations can leverage systems like<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener nofollow">Track</a><span>&nbsp;</span>to not only leverage proof of presence details for actual hours worked by contracting personnel, but can apply the contractual terms and conditions automatically to reduce leakage and increase visibility and transparency between the buyer and supplier. This drives more confidence between both parties that accrued work will be paid based on the contractual terms and conditions.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h2 id="b603">Receive an invoice from the supplier for the goods or services procured</h2>
                <p id="a592" data-selectable-paragraph="">When an invoice is received from a seller or supplier, buyers perform a validation that the goods or services were received before payment. In part 4 in this series, we will discuss the Invoice-to-Pay Process further; however, we will go into two concept now: Three-Way and Two-Way Match.</p>
                <ul>
                <li id="e423" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Three-Way Match:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>Typically used for goods purchases, the buyer compares the request from the Purchase Order with the quantity and price listed on the Goods Receipt and the Invoice. If all three match up, then the invoice can be paid. If there are discrepancies between the three documents, then it would require manual intervention to review and dispute the invoice. This Three-Way match process can be automated through Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.</li>
                <li id="a73d" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Two-Way Match:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>Two-Way matches looks at only two documents: the Purchase Order and the Invoice. This is used more in services where the timesheet described above is used as a backup to the invoice. While this method can be used for validation for goods purchases, it can drive increased risk for higher dollar values. As a result, it is often limited to dollar values where the trade-off between potential overpayment and ability to obtain discounts on payment term are realized.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><!--more--></p>
                <section>
                <section>
                <p id="aed8" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Invoice-to-Pay process starts with the invoice received during<span>&nbsp;</span>the <a href="/procure-to-invoice-how-to-master-the-process" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Procure-to-Invoice Process</a>, obtaining any necessary approvals, and processing the payment according to payment terms.</p>
                <p id="94e7" data-selectable-paragraph="">When an invoice is received from a Supplier and the necessary matches are confirmed, as discussed in<span>&nbsp;</span>part 3 of this series, it goes through any additional approvals required based on your company’s process. Some companies require approval from business leaders, other require final review from Accounts Payable, and some approve the invoice based on the matching process alone.</p>
                <p id="0ea8" data-selectable-paragraph="">After the necessa<span id="rmm">r</span>y approvals are received, the payment for the approved invoice is processed according to the agreed payment terms.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 id="68d9">Payment Terms</h3>
                <p id="ce25" data-selectable-paragraph="">To ensure timely payment of the invoice to a Supplier, payment terms are agreed to in advance. Payment terms are an important part of the cash flow cycle for the Buyer and Supplier. Payment terms are commonly “Net”, “Discount”, or “End of Month” terms. That said, there are other types of payment term that are utilized often within the supply chain.</p>
                <p id="9043" data-selectable-paragraph="">Below, we will go into the three common types of payment terms:</p>
                <ul>
                <li id="c78e" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Net Terms<span>&nbsp;</span></em>indicates that the total payment for the invoice is due within some number of days. Typically, you’ll see Net terms as Net 7, 10, 20, 30, 60 or 90 days; however, other net terms, such as Net 120, may also apply based on the agreement.</li>
                <li id="ce0a" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Discount Terms<span>&nbsp;</span></em>drives an incentive to pay invoices sooner to receive a discount on the total cost of the invoice. Although this concept seems like a “win” for the Buyer and a “lose” for the Supplier, it can actually be a “win-win” if agreed to by both parties. For the Supplier, it can drive faster cash flows by receiving payments sooner. For the Buyer, it allows the invoice to be discounted slightly to have a lower total cost. Typically, you’ll see Discount Terms shown in the following format: “<em>X</em>%<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Y</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Net<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Z</em>”. In this format,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>X</em><span>&nbsp;</span>defines the percentage of the total amount of the invoice that will be discounted if paid in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Y</em><span>&nbsp;</span>days. If the discount period passes, the full amount with no discount is due in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Z</em><span>&nbsp;</span>days.</li>
                <li id="9040" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>End of Month Terms<span>&nbsp;</span></em>simply indicates that the payment of the invoice is due at the end of the month.</li>
                </ul>
                <p id="1566" data-selectable-paragraph="">Another facet of payment terms is about the date in which they begin their calculation. Payment terms can start from the day that the Supplier sends the invoice, the day the Buyer “accepts” the invoice, or other agreed to dates in within the process. Being clear about the start date of payment terms can reduce confusion and frustration between the Buyer and Supplier within the relationship.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 id="9f28">Payment</h3>
                <p id="87d9" data-selectable-paragraph="">Payment of the invoice and receipt of that payment closes out the Invoice-to-Pay process. After the Payment Terms are reached, the funds are sent to the Supplier. The payment may be in the form of a check, wire, Evaluated Receipt Settlement (ERS), or other payment form. We are starting to see the emergence of Blockchain supporting this process as well.</p>
                <p id="99ff" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once the payment is received by the Supplier, the Invoice-to-Pay process is complete for that transaction or invoice. Depending on the purchase or the type of relationship a Buyer has with a Supplier, additional invoices and payments may be made until the total project or contract is completed.</p>
                <p id="9c17" data-selectable-paragraph="">Managing these transactions and the overall relationship with the Supplier is what we will cover in Part 5.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 id="ae76">Invoice Disputes</h3>
                <p id="07a8" data-selectable-paragraph="">Unfortunately, not every invoice smoothly goes through this process. Sometimes there are differences between the Buyer and the Supplier as it relates to an invoice. These disputes can range in financial value, but often cause strain between both parties in the relationship.</p>
                <p id="a948" data-selectable-paragraph="">Invoice disputes may occur during the initial matching process. A system, or person, may detect a difference between the pieces of information submitted and “reject” the invoice back to the Supplier for correction. This could be something like a mismatched billing address or quantities and prices not matching. It can also be disputed during the additional approval process where people are validating the invoice to other documentation provided by the Supplier for final validation.</p>
                <p id="ac1b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Finally, invoice disputes may arise during an audit. Disputes may arise due to issues that both parties didn’t catch during the initial submission that didn’t align to contractual terms and conditions, resulting in required debits or credits.</p>
                <p id="dc76" data-selectable-paragraph="">There is good news! There is a system that can reduce invoice disputes between the Supplier and Buyer upstream of the invoicing process. Look forward to a future article about this system in the future.</p>

                <h2>Can your VMS ensure you are paying your contractors correctly?</h2>
                <p>A vendor management system (VMS) is an application to procure and manage staffing services for contingent workers. The complexity of maintaining consistent contract terms, conditions, and rates and schedules across multiple locations and thousands of contractors/vendors extends well beyond the scope of a VMS. Our <span style="color: #3d85c6;"><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color: #3d85c6;"><span style="color: #0600ff;">Track Platform</span></a></span> is the market lead in true real-time contractor billable hours management that allows owners to agree and authorize their supplier's invoices. More importantly, invoices are true and accurate, eliminating millions of dollars in overspend. A VMS could help businesses source contractors, but TRACK will will ensure they maintain compliance and are paid based upon what they have earned.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>VMS's certainly have a place in helping to procure labor services. However, they are not equipped to enforce the terms, conditions, rates, and schedules of the contract that apply to these services. <span style="color: #3d85c6;"><a href="https://info.managementcontrols.com/electric-utility-case-study" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color: #3d85c6;"><span style="color: #0600ff;">Owners lose millions of dollars</span></a></span> a day by paying at gross hours versus net billable hours. The TRACK Platform is the premier contractor management solution used at over <span style="color: #3d85c6;"><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/our-customers" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color: #3d85c6;"><span style="color: #0600ff;">300 industrial sites</span></a></span>, including over 90% of North American refining capacity.&nbsp;</p>

                <li>Owners can allocate across multiple vendor crafts/rates per contractor per shift.</li>
                <li>Owners can calculate spend/progress across projects or work orders for labor, equipment, and materials per contractor.&nbsp;</li>

                <![CDATA[<p><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Depositphotos_154245156_s-2019.jpg" alt="digitization contractor workforce" width="1000" loading="lazy" style="width: 1000px;">With the current state of the economy, many businesses are still in survival mode working to cut costs, eliminate unnecessary spend, and working to regain profitability. While many industries thus far have weathered strong through the storm, consideration must be made to adopt digital solutions to increase transparency, cost controls, and streamline business processes.</p>
                <!--more-->
                <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">Into the Future: 2021 &amp; Beyond</h3>
                <p>In the first month of 2021, many companies across industries are assessing their retrospectives with future initiatives. The year 2020 and the onset of the global pandemic prompted contingency plans across businesses worldwide. A cumulative approach to goal setting for the new year is to consider industry trends, and what challenges the industry faces separate (and considering) the pandemic’s influence on the economy and workforce. The ever-evolving digital demand and the coming of Industry 4.0 (Fourth Industrial Revolution) brings further advanced technology to the mining industry.</p>
                <p>To prepare your business for the future, the time is now to adopt digital tools like the TRACK® Platform from MCi to reduce a company’s manual processes and promote more accurate spending and allocating of time and resources.</p>
                <p>For the sake of continued process improvement and to future-proof your business, take advantage of digital tools to reduce costs and make contractor management more efficient, more transparent. In doing so, companies reduce bottlenecks, more accurately control spending, and increase successful project results.</p>
                <p>{{cta('30ff2c61-cd49-49c4-aecd-ed934c6fdd6d')}}</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">Standard Management Software Won’t Cut It</h3>
                <p>Standard contractor management software only tackles a few of the heavy industry’s administrative challenges. Most products don’t offer all the features you need for an all-in-one digitized experience. The purpose of digitizing your business is to streamline, not to complicate an already intricate course of management with thousands of contractors.</p>
                <p>The right contractor management software can help you toward your goals for improving processes and better managing costs. TRACK® Platform is an all-in-one software solution that<a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/earned-value-management" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> <span style="color: #954f72; text-decoration: underline;">automatically calculates the exact cost of each contractor</span></a>, whereas other platforms rely on time input from contractors that can't easily be validated. As a result, TRACK® helps contractor management companies by reducing overpayments and preventing inaccuracies.&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">TRACK’s Key Features:</h3>
                <p>TRACK Platform is an all-in-one contractor management software that gives companies real-time visibility into the skill mix on-site and enables owners to properly assess talent, reducing delays and setbacks due to the wrong skill mix. Such insight is paramount to managing resources, as not just skill mix, but availability and scheduling could become increasingly tricky as the pandemic continues and possible economic downturn looms.</p>
                <ul>
                <li aria-level="1">Streamline business processes – eliminates manual timesheet processing, invoice handling, and post-invoice reconciliation.</li>
                <li aria-level="1">Automated &amp; accurate invoices – automatically calculates contractually accurate labor, rates, and schedules to achieve net time.</li>
                <li aria-level="1">Manpower visibility – gain real-time workforce visibility, fatigue status, and time, on-site.</li>
                <li aria-level="1">Manage spend – delivers daily visibility and control of contractor costs at the po and wo level, down to the individual.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>{{cta('51d73431-0425-41be-9bf7-48668835b1de')}}</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">Future-Proofing – Saving on Costs Too</h3>
                <p>Powerful digital tools like the <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener">TRACK® Platform</a> from MCi can help you easily automate your processes in an all-in-one solution that eliminates the need for manual spreadsheets to control, manage, and reduce contractor labor, equipment, and materials spend. With real-time visibility into daily operations and built-in contract compliance, TRACK helps streamlines business processes that increase productivity and reduce cost. Using TRACK every day can help companies achieve up to 10-15% in annual savings while tightening controls over labor activity. Real-time reporting of activity, including spend, gives your company fast and accurate information to proactively manage <a href="/track-through-the-eyes-of-a-former-maintenance-manager" rel="noopener" target="_blank">routine maintenance</a> and large projects. Allow MCi’s TRACK Platform to help you stay ahead of economic hurdles, and to propel your business into the future digitally.&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">Mining Industries in 2020: Retrospective</h3>
                <p>When we look back at 2020, we can consider the <a href="/4-strategies-to-control-mining-contractor-service-costs-during-an-economic-turndown" rel="noopener">pandemic’s effect on productivity and cost</a> (i.e., lockdowns, contractor availability, health and safety.) The mining industry remained solid, but not without noticeable and reoccurring pain points, such as proper skill mix, manpower visibility, and staying within budget. According to McKinsey &amp; Company, four out of five mining projects are completed late or over budget, by an average of 43%.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>While other industries are braced for potential economic crisis, the mining industry has everything to gain from investing in tools to future-proof their businesses.</p>
                <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">Overview of MCi’s Study of 100 Mining Companies</h3>
                <p>Management Controls (MCi) set out to better understand the highs and lows of contractor management by <a href="/pressrelease/the-state-of-contractor-management-in-mining" rel="noopener">surveying 100 mining companies</a>. In analyzing our survey data, MCi found that:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><span style="font-size: 7px;"> &nbsp; </span> 60% of surveyed companies reported projects being behind schedule and over budget</li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 7px;"> &nbsp; </span> Enterprise-wide contractor spend is upward of $1 billion per year for 11% of companies</li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 7px;"> &nbsp; </span> Nearly 90% of respondents are using manual spreadsheets to track project metrics such as completion, productivity, budget, and timeliness</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a majority of mining companies have recently reported that contractor management is costing them so much time and money, then the next approach to overcoming these pain points is to digitize the model – and not just with any contractor management software – the right one for your business.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" style="color: #954f72;"><span>TRACK® Platform</span></a> is contractor management software that empowers companies with a far more efficient means for tracking the costs of labor, equipment and materials. Today, at over 300 sites worldwide, our platform processes more than $50 billion annually in contractor spending. TRACK’s proprietary real time insights, increased transparency and time saving automation, saves our customers an average of 15% on total contractor spend each year. That’s a savings to aspire to.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/insights"><span>TRACK also offers real-time fatigue management and alerting</span></a>. Fatigue is tied to the individual, so TRACK can tell owners when a individual has been on site more days that their fatigue thresholds (typically 14 days in a row) and it can tell owners when a resource has been on site for more than 12 hours in a day.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px;"><em>In Part 5 of the procurement series, Anna Van Cleef discusses the supplier management process and best practices for procurement professionals.&nbsp;</em></p>
                <p><!--more--></p>
                <section>
                <section>
                <section>
                <div>
                <div>
                <p id="c9b4" data-selectable-paragraph="">Sourcing and Procurement professionals engage with suppliers each day to drive toward company goals and objectives. Given the right relationships, it can drive competitive advantage, productivity, and ultimate customer satisfaction. To enable these things, we leverage Supplier Management.</p>
                <p id="8c4f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Supplier Management drives toward a win-win relationship between customers and suppliers to maximize return on investment (ROI) and minimize risk in the supply chain. There are various aspects to Supplier Management. We will be discussing negotiations, policies, performance management, and communication in this article.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 id="017f">Negotiations</h3>
                <p id="c9ce" data-selectable-paragraph="">As noted in<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="/source-to-contract-how-to-master-the-process" rel="noopener" target="_blank">part t<span id="rmm">w</span>o</a><span>&nbsp;</span>of this series, knowing your company’s strategy and position is key before negotiations start. Think about how you will manage the supplier during the relationship. How will the negotiated contract create value to your organization and the overall supply chain? Embedding your company’s goals and objectives into the negotiation and the contractual agreement will help you to better manage the relationship from the start.</p>
                <p id="f452" data-selectable-paragraph="">Be sure to include performance criteria within the contract. This allows you to review the performance measure with your suppliers throughout the life of the relationship.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 id="3a3d">Policies</h3>
                <p id="bd68" data-selectable-paragraph="">Supplier Policies, or codes of conduct, define the standards you hold all suppliers to with which your company does business. These policies might include labor or work standards, ethics, environmental, guiding principles, or other key aspects that are important to your company. Type in “Supplier Code of Conduct” into Google to see various examples from companies of various sizes for examples.</p>
                <p id="8b4f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Regardless of what is included for your company, aspects of your company’s Supplier Policy should be closely monitored and clear incentives for superior performance or penalties when suppliers do not meet the standard should be defined. Ensure that your company’s policies are called out within your contract and the positive or negative consequences that can result.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 id="51a8">Performance Management</h3>
                <p id="5a16" data-selectable-paragraph="">Performance Management is a critical part of the Supplier Management process. As noted above, including performance criteria within your contact is important to objective management of the supplier relationship.</p>
                <p id="2823" data-selectable-paragraph="">As an example, if the supplier is supply goods to your company, you may have a tolerance within which each good needs to fit. You may include a performance criteria that defines the expectation for delivering goods that meet the specified tolerance. If you have a services supplier, you might tie their performance criteria to quality of work or another key measure.</p>
                <p id="600f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Remember, “What gets measured gets done” which has been attributed to Peter Drucker, Tom Peters, Edwards Deming, Lord Kelvin, and others. Just because something is easy to measure, doesn’t mean it is the right thing to measure. Based on the desired outcomes for your company, determine what the right measures are that would not have negative or adverse secondary consequences.</p>
                <p id="49b4" data-selectable-paragraph="">For example, if a contract has a performance measure to “deliver X lines of codes in Y days”, developers can simply write lines of code that are never called and meet the criteria for the performance measure. In this example, these additional lines could create little value in the overall supply chain and drain resources. Select the right performance measures for your business to ensure that the goals are achieved.</p>
                <p id="af7c" data-selectable-paragraph="">A final point about performance measures would be to meet with the supplier regularly to discuss progress toward the measures in the contract. Support your statements with data to back-up your position of their excellent, good, average, or poor performance to remove frustration about subjective opinions.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 id="deb9">Communication</h3>
                <p id="e5dd" data-selectable-paragraph="">Just like most things in life, communication is key. Communication with your suppliers is important to creating value in the supply chain so everyone is working toward the same goal.</p>
                <p id="47fa" data-selectable-paragraph="">Leveraging an example from<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Polanyi" rel="noopener nofollow">Michael Polyani’s</a><span>&nbsp;</span>“The Republic of Science”, the most efficient way to solve a jigsaw puzzle is not to have many people work separately on different pieces of the puzzle. Rather, it is by everyone working together in cooperation. Each time a piece of the puzzle is fitted in, others will immediately watch out for the next step that becomes possible in consequence. In this system, each participant will act on her own initiative, by responding to the latest achievements of the others, and the completion of their joint task will be greatly accelerated.</p>
                <p id="5748" data-selectable-paragraph="">In summary, not communicating key pieces of information doesn’t just impact those without that knowledge, but it could impact both parties toward achieving the goal efficiently and effectively.</p>
                <p id="a6ba" data-selectable-paragraph="">But what is the right level of communication? This is based on many things such as the type of contractual relationship, the type of good or service being purchased, the goals and objectives for the relationship, confidentiality requirements, and much more. Ultimately, it is a judgement call for each situation how much is the right level of communication and cooperation.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>

                <![CDATA[<p data-selectable-paragraph=""><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Contract-Health-Check-COMPRESSED.jpg" alt="Contract-Health-Check-COMPRESSED" width="6000" loading="lazy" style="width: 6000px;"></p>
                <p id="5178" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Read our next blog post for Sourcing and Procurement professionals from Anna Van Cleef about Time and Material contracts and best practices for this strategy.</em></p>
                <!--more-->
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">Time and Material is a widely used contract strategy for Sourcing and Procurement professionals around the world. It allows Buyers to pay Suppliers for the direct materials, hourly rates, subcontracting, and equipment charges necessary for the completion of work. Each contracting strategy comes with its benefits and challenges. This article provides details on these topics for Time and Material contracts as well as tools to overcome obstacles.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 id="331b">Why would you use a Time and Material contracting strategy?</h3>
                <p id="91e7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Time and Material contracts allow for more flexibility and are best utilized when:</p>
                <ul>
                <li id="dec1" data-selectable-paragraph="">the scope of the project is not well defined,</li>
                <li id="15a6" data-selectable-paragraph="">there is a medium to high probability of requirements changing,</li>
                <li id="03cc" data-selectable-paragraph="">the project has a longer duration, and</li>
                <li id="700d" data-selectable-paragraph="">an engagement requires a change order.</li>
                </ul>
                <p id="0a64" data-selectable-paragraph="">Various types of eng<span id="rmm">a</span>gements may require flexibility in scope or timeline. For example, construction work, security, consulting services, and general maintenance activities are all engagements where a Time and Materials contracting strategy might be utilized. This allows for flexible scope and changing requirements throughout the life of the engagement.</p>
                <p id="7542" data-selectable-paragraph="">In this model, Buyers benefit by only paying for the labor, equipment, and material charges that are associated with the engagement. Suppliers benefit because they are exposed to less risk if the scope of the engagement changes. Because the Supplier has less risk, they limit the “padding” they include in their estimates to account for unforeseen work which can help the Buyer in return.</p>
                <p id="4667" data-selectable-paragraph="">Time and Material contracts are also particularly useful for longer-duration projects or engagements. Longer engagements can often evolve over time increasing the value of the flexible nature of this contracting strategy.</p>
                <p id="dfbc" data-selectable-paragraph="">A Time and Material contracting approach is often utilized when change orders are required for services, regardless of the original contracting strategy. A change order is an amendment to an agreement that resulted from changing requirements, scope, timelines, or underestimated costs. The flexibility for Time and Material makes it particularly useful for change orders when the need arises.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 id="88fb">What are the challenges of Time and Material Contracts?</h3>
                <p id="3b9a" data-selectable-paragraph="">While harnessing the flexibility that Time and Material contracts provide, they are not without their challenges.</p>
                <p id="d4f8" data-selectable-paragraph="">Suppliers are not incentivized to perform work efficiently; by paying an hourly rate, the Supplier can find benefit in extending the time to complete the work leading to a need for oversight. Oversight requires internal manpower which could increase internal costs or redirect manpower to providing oversight for engagements. With a lack of data and information related to the work completed, even with oversight, internal resources can end up “pencil whipping” timesheets and invoices. As a result, there is a potential for overpayment and additional work on the backend of the process to recuperate the overpayment.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 id="eec7">What can help me manage Time and Material Contracts?</h3>
                <p id="8a69" data-selectable-paragraph="">Internal resources having oversight of the work being performed increases the sense of urgency to complete the work for the engagement; however, designated resources cannot be everywhere at the same time. With that in mind, how can the buying organization be confident that what is being paid is in alignment with the Supplier’s work and contract?</p>
                <p id="ee1a" data-selectable-paragraph="">One potential option is to leverage a Contractor Management Software, such as<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener">Track</a>, which leverages the site’s Proof of Presence solution, or a mobile alternative, to validate that contractor personnel are onsite and automatically applies contractual terms and conditions to the hours worked. This can provide more confidence and data to support charges driving visibility and transparency between the Buyer and Supplier. With the same system managing material and equipment charges, all the contractual costs for services suppliers can be managed in one system. With this type of capability, the Time and Material contract strategy becomes a practical solution that reduces the chances of overpayment while paying the Supplier the accrued costs in a timely manner.</p>
                <p id="101a" data-selectable-paragraph="">Some companies have gone away from Time and Material contracts altogether in favor of Fixed Fee, or Lump Sum, contracts. While taking this approach can reduce the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>feeling<span>&nbsp;</span></em>that oversight is necessary, this contracting strategy has its own benefits and challenges. Look for a future article on Fixed Fee, or Lump Sum, contracts.</p>

                <!--more-->
                <h3 id="15e9">Why would you use a Supplier Scorecard?</h3>
                <p id="8a81" data-selectable-paragraph="">Companies want to partner with suppliers that help them meet business goals and objectives. Leveraging a tool like the Supplier Scorecard can assist in selecting the best Supplier for an engagement. In addition, it can help to combat:</p>
                <ul>
                <li id="76e5" data-selectable-paragraph="">‘Always’ selecting the lowest bidder,</li>
                <li id="aa08" data-selectable-paragraph="">‘Always’ going with the highest paid person’s opinion,</li>
                <li id="432a" data-selectable-paragraph="">Only selecting suppliers encountered in the past, and</li>
                <li id="3855" data-selectable-paragraph="">Taking a subjective approach to supplier selection.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                <h3 id="b3d3">How are Supplier Scorecards used in Supplier Selection?</h3>
                <p id="f92f" data-selectable-paragraph="">As mentioned in<span>&nbsp;</span><a rel="noopener" href="/source-to-contract-how-to-master-the-process" target="_blank">Part 2<span>&nbsp;</span></a>of the Source-to-Pa<span id="rmm">y</span><span>&nbsp;</span>series, the use of a Supplier Scorecard during the selection process starts by defining specific performance measures that are important to the organization for the engagement. Once the measures are identified, a weighting is placed on each measure based on its importance. Information is gathered, and each supplier’s scores are placed in the scorecard and a ranked list of suppliers is determined. Based on the data-driven measures, the Supplier with highest rank would be selected and alternates can be defined.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 id="f98b">How are Supplier Scorecards used in Supplier Management?</h3>
                <p id="b9d9" data-selectable-paragraph="">By sharing your criteria with the selected supplier, they are better able to understand what is important to your organization and how they can meet the defined objectives. Leveraging these data-driven metrics in an ongoing, collaborative way also helps the supplier to be clear about expectations and take pride in the long-term relationship with your company.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 id="c825">How to avoid Supplier Scorecarding Pitfalls?</h3>
                <p id="7ff0" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Supplier Scorecard can be a powerful tool; however, it is important to start by addressing some of the pitfalls that can occur.</p>
                <p id="713d" data-selectable-paragraph="">First, be sure to define the right metrics that lead to value creation for your organization and the Supply Chain. Simply selecting measures that are readily available won’t guarantee that you end up with the desired result. Go through the exercise of determining the right measures for the engagement.</p>
                <p id="4f4a" data-selectable-paragraph="">In a similar line of thinking, using the same measures for all engagements may not lead to the desired end goal. Leverage the goals and objectives for each engagement to determine the right measures each time.</p>
                <p id="c851" data-selectable-paragraph="">Third, it is possible that the measures selected could lead to unintentional consequences. Review the measures being considered and the potential behaviors and outcomes that could result before making for your final decisions.</p>
                <p id="d3e6" data-selectable-paragraph="">Finally, once your evaluation team has defined the weighting of each measure, don’t change it after the fact to get a ‘desired’ answer. By changing the weighting after the fact, it defeats the purpose of the tool. Agree up front what is important for the engagement and don’t make changes during the selection process.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 id="7dc4">Are you ready to start using a Supplier Scorecard?</h3>
                <p id="7771" data-selectable-paragraph="">Your organization may already have a Supplier Scorecard template designed to meet your business needs; however, if you’re starting from scratch, consider downloading a template from<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q2roxwZan8yL-wJm02wi7ip6KKsTSKcs/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener nofollow">this link</a><span>&nbsp;</span>to get you started.</p>

                <p><em>&nbsp;Regarding: Track Anywhere</em></p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;I recently attended a webinar in 2020 and TRACK Anywhere was mentioned on the call. Can you tell me a little more about it?</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</p>
                <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track-anywhere" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color: #000000;"><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/track%20anywhere%20landing%20page%20image_VG%20&amp;%20KIOSK%20v3.jpg" alt="track anywhere landing page image_VG &amp; KIOSK v3" width="500" loading="lazy" style="width: 500px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;"></a>

                <h2>Have you considered customizing your TRACK training?</h2>
                <p>What drives daily business processes and improves organizational performance?</p>
                <p>A custom training program meets the specific business needs of an organization with one-of-a-kind training content. It allows for an infusion of branding and culture&nbsp;into learning processes. An effective custom training program targets learning objectives and includes a clear plan of how the processes will be structured and delivered to meet the organization's performance goals.</p>
                <p>Here are three reasons to consider tailoring your TRACK application training material for your specific needs:&nbsp;</p>
                <ol>
                <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                <ol>
                <li><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"><strong>Challenges with Business-Specific Practices:</strong> Clients with specific needs regarding their business practices may find that having generic training material doesn't drive the right behaviors to produce the proper outcomes. Customized training can fill the gap between the requirements in the software and the Client’s expectations. </span></li>
                <li><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"><strong>Differences in Terminology:</strong> Clients who refer to the TRACK application and its functionalities with dissimilar vocabulary may find it difficult to communicate information and directives if the training and application do not share the same branding. Aligning your training material with your software naming conventions could minimize delays in work completion as well as confusion for both Vendors and Clients. Customers using another vocabulary in the TRACK application will also value customization.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"> </span></li>
                <li><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"><strong>Alignment in Users and Expectations:</strong> Customized training allows organizations to close the gap between TRACK application users and expectations. By providing tailor-made learning experiences, organizations can </span><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">control the content and context of information that is presented to learners</span><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">. Managing content means creating materials that meet specific organizational learning goals and using key performance indicators (KPIs) to identify employees' needs to be successful.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;</span></li>
                </ol>
                </li>
                </ol>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p>For more information about customized training, don't hesitate to contact your MCi Account Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded>
                <![CDATA[<p id="c8a1" data-selectable-paragraph="">Are you leveraging Fixed Fee contracting strategies where it can create the most value for your organization? Find out here.</p>
                <!--more-->
                <p id="b1c2" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Fixed Fee contracting strategy defines a fixed amount for payment at the beginning of a contractual engagement. By its nature, this contracting strategy is inflexible, but has its place in creating value in the supply chain.</p>
                <h3 id="4661">Why would you use a Fixed Fee contracting strategy?</h3>
                <p id="f526" data-selectable-paragraph="" style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed Fee is best utilized when:</p>
                <ul>
                <li id="26c9" data-selectable-paragraph="">the requirements of the engagement are completely defined up front,</li>
                <li id="5f74" data-selectable-paragraph="">the requirements are clearly documented for expectations management, or</li>
                <li id="dbd7" data-selectable-paragraph="">the project has been completed several times in the past and effort to complete the engagement is well known.</li>
                </ul>
                <p id="f434" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Fixed Fee strategy shifts the risk of additional costs or timeline delays to complete the defined scope to the supplier. While this could drive an increase in the original estimate from the supplier, there is a perceived comfort from those that manage project and company budgets that the cost is known.</p>
                <h3 id="6ccc">What are the challenges of Fixed Fee Contracts?</h3>
                <p id="9448" data-selectable-paragraph="">While<span id="rmm"><span>&nbsp;</span></span>there can be comfort in a known budget for an engagement, Fixed Fee contracts are not without their challenges.</p>
                <p id="72d6" data-selectable-paragraph="">Much like the perceived comfort of a known budget, companies may believe that oversight of the supplier's work is not required, or at least is decreased significantly, by internal resources. This could lead to finding out later that expectations were not well understood, resulting in delays in the project timeline. If timeline delays are a concern, this could present challenges despite the fact that the cost would not necessarily increase.</p>
                <p id="c898" data-selectable-paragraph="">As noted in the previous section, the risk of additional work to complete the original scope is transitioned to the supplier. To provide the supplier with a bit of protection, they add a risk premium to prevent a loss on the work performed. If this is acceptable to your business, then this may not be a specific concern.</p>
                <p id="d40b" data-selectable-paragraph="">While this contracting strategy can shine if the scope is<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><em>completely</em></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>defined upfront, it is often utilized when the scope has some ambiguity still remaining. This can often lead to additional clarification on requirements or scope creep, requiring a change order to be created. The more often this occurs, the benefit of a defined budget is reduced.</p>
                <p id="cef3" data-selectable-paragraph="">Fixed Fee contracting strategies are often utilized on projects that have been completed in the past. However, without details about the direct charges necessary for completing the work, it can be challenging to ensure the estimate is based on historical actuals.</p>
                <p id="c31f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Sometimes, the Fixed Fee contracting strategy can become a company default. If this is the case for your organization, you may be spending more time defining the explicit scope of work to be accomplished when another contracting strategy could provide greater benefit to your organization for that engagement.</p>
                <h3 id="128a">What can help me manage Fixed Fee Contracts?</h3>
                <p id="6ed0" data-selectable-paragraph="">The first suggestion is to leverage internal resources to provide the appropriate oversight for work performed to reduce the risk of timeline delays.</p>
                <p id="9875" data-selectable-paragraph="">Second, consider leveraging a Contractor Management Software, such as<span style="color: #0600ff;">&nbsp;<a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" style="color: #0600ff;">Track</a></span>. While the strategy is based on a fixed priced paid in progress payments, milestone payments, or a one-time payment, leveraging a site’s Proof of Presence solution, or a mobile alternative can help to provide the historical data to help with validating costs, challenging change orders, and scoping efforts in the future.</p>
                <p id="a8a5" data-selectable-paragraph="">Finally, consider how your organization is leveraging the Fixed Fee contracting strategy. How often is it utilized and for what types of work? Are there opportunities to increase or decrease its use based on the engagements of the past? Leverage this analysis to change behavior in the future to create value for your organization.</p>

                <p id="5178" data-selectable-paragraph="" style="font-size: 16px;"><em>Are you looking to improve the relationships between your company and your supply base? Here are 5 tips that you can you start using today to improve your Supplier Relationships!</em></p>
                <!--more-->
                <p id="2bc5" data-selectable-paragraph="">Supplier Management is a core function of the Sourcing and Procurement capability within any organization. Sometimes, its importance can take a backseat to the endless meetings, action items, and daily fires that can arise. If performed right, however, Supplier Management can help to reduce the number of fires and keep the focus on achieving your company’s goals. In this article, we will discuss five tips to improving alignment between your company and your supply base.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h2 id="dcae">1. Work Towards Win-Win Solutions</h2>
                <p id="9f2c" data-selectable-paragraph="">Regardless of the type of<span id="rmm"><span>&nbsp;</span></span>relationship your company has with a supplier (i.e. — strategic, tactical, or transactional), the desired outcome should be a win-win for both parties. If your company’s objective in interactions is to accomplish its desired goals regardless of the burden to your supplier, this hurts the relationship and alignment between the parties. Similarly, if your supplier isn’t helping you to achieve your company’s goals when the impact would be low to their business, this also fragments the relationship.</p>
                <p id="92ae" data-selectable-paragraph="">With this in mind, how can you drive to win-win solutions? Look at the goals for your company and determine the priority items that will lead to the wins for your business. Reflect on the goals of your supplier and listen to their concerns. If one of your goals conflicts with their concerns, brainstorm<span>&nbsp;</span><em>together</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a different approach that can help you accomplish the goal without negatively impacting their ability to support their customer base. Together you can determine a compromise that benefits both parties — a win-win solution.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h2 id="7564">2. Communicate Clear Expectations</h2>
                <p id="ef1e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Unclear expectations leads to frustration and missed goals. Being clear up-front with your suppliers can ensure that both parties are on the same page before the engagement begins. But, that isn’t where communication should stop. Communicating regularly with your suppliers allows them to course correct when needed without damaging the relationship. It allows them to understand what is important to your business in changing times to support your company in an agile way.</p>
                <p id="0ac3" data-selectable-paragraph="">Without regular communication, both parties are left with assumptions of what the other is expecting or going to accomplish in a certain time period. These assumptions can lead to failed projects or engagements. Communicate assumptions, expectations, and requirements regularly to reduce the friction in the relationship and improve alignment.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h2 id="9b75">3. Alignment of Vision</h2>
                <p id="f867" data-selectable-paragraph="">As you search for partners in the supply chain, seek out suppliers that align to the vision of your company. If both companies are driving toward a similar goal, it makes it easier to work together even when challenging times occur.</p>
                <p id="6957" data-selectable-paragraph="">Partnering with suppliers that don’t align to the vision of your company can cause distrust in the relationship if the supplier begins making choices that conflict with your vision. For example, if you’re company is focused on it environmental impact, and a supplier doesn’t align with that vision, they may make choice that align with their business model which could inadvertently cause your organization’s integrity to be called into question. By working with suppliers that align to your company’s vision, this risk is reduced and both parties can work together toward solving the common goal.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h2 id="1ad2">4. Leverage Data to Drive Behavior</h2>
                <p id="89b4" data-selectable-paragraph="">Measuring the right things for your business will help to drive clear expectations. Defining performance measures upfront and walking through them regularly with the supplier not only improves communication, but can focus the conversation on what matters for your business.</p>
                <p id="b295" data-selectable-paragraph="">During performance reviews, leverage data to drive the communication. This can enable direct, fact-based discussion about adherence to expectations that were aligned beforehand. This type of approach shifts toward objective conversations which can keep relationships intact, even when difficult conversations are necessary.</p>

                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h2 id="0197">5. Leverage Technology</h2>
                <p id="712b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Leveraging technology to create alignment in your supplier relationships can improve the daily processes of engaging with suppliers. While there are many options such as e-commerce, contract management systems, supplier relationship management systems, or enhancing capabilities through automation, predictive analytics, AI and machine learning, or blockchain, it is all about what makes sense for your business and your relationships with suppliers.</p>
                <p id="1251" data-selectable-paragraph="">Leveraging technology can empower teams to achieve goals and deliver better solutions than were once considered possible. Apply the aspects of technology that can help your business flourish working together with your supply base to make your company’s vision a reality.</p>

                <p id="9fca" data-selectable-paragraph="">Customer Demand is the main driver of Supply Chain Planning. Understanding the timing and magnitude of this demand informs when, and how long Supply Chain maintenance should best occur.<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/earned-value-management" rel="noopener nofollow">Forecaster</a><span>&nbsp;</span>is the data hub that Supply Chain teams can use to track interruptions and their cost impacts in near real time.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 id="fb64">Sourcing and Procurement</h3>
                <p id="a996" data-selectable-paragraph="">The TRACK® Platform enables the contractual terms and conditions that Sourcing and Procurement professionals define to be automatically applied to the daily work of contracted personnel through the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener nofollow">TRACK</a><span>&nbsp;</span>solution. This means that contractual terms and rates can be applied to resources utilized to complete the work. Leveraging Proof of Presence (PoP) solutions such as Access Control Systems or<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track-anywhere" rel="noopener nofollow">TRACK Anywhere</a>, TRACK leverages the actual badging information for contracted personnel and applies contractual rules to define “Net Billable Time”, or the time to be paid to the supplier after contractual terms (such as lunch deductions, rounding rules, etc.) are automatically applied. Taking this time, TRACK applies the appropriate rate to ensure that there is adherence to the agreement.</p>
                <p id="711e" data-selectable-paragraph="">TRACK does not stop at Labor resources; it also supports material charges, supplier-owned equipment, unit price charges, lump sum charges, and sub-contracted spend. TRACK ensures that the appropriate rate is applied to contracted spend driving automated and accurate invoicing.</p>
                <p id="0b3b" data-selectable-paragraph="">TRACK provides digital transformation within the Procure-to-Pay process not only by applying the terms and conditions to work completed, but also enables those costs to be applied to cost objects (purchase orders, work orders, etc.) and sent to your company’s Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system for payment to the vendor. This can reduce delays in the Invoice-to-Pay process improving the relationship between both parties.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 id="c51d">Manufacturing/Projects</h3>
                <p id="954f" data-selectable-paragraph="">As mentioned in the Sourcing and Procurement section, the TRACK® Platform leverages Proof of Presence data to apply costs to the work to be done. The TRACK® Platform can provide insight into the suppliers with which your company is doing business through the lens of planned work versus actuals leveraging TRACK and Forecaster. The platform enables companies to compare expected staffing needs of planned work to the actual staffing supplied. It can also help to bring visibility between what work was planned and what was accomplished.</p>
                <p id="0807" data-selectable-paragraph="">The combination of TRACK and Forecaster uniquely delivers accurate actuals on a daily basis. Unparalleled access to actuals allows Customers to collect and analyze each project’s Earned Value on a weekly basis. Project Controls teams can then present Senior Management with the real project timeline and expected costs.</p>
                <h2 data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</h2>
                <h3 id="33b5">Summary</h3>
                <p id="7906" data-selectable-paragraph="">Regardless of your industry vertical, the TRACK® Platform can support your business in managing its services-based supply chain, enabling you and your suppliers to accomplish business goals and objectives.</p>

                <div>
                <p id="e84c" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Unit Price contracting strategy can be leveraged in several industries and situations where the work to be performed can be broken into units, or predefined blocks. These units of work can be defined at different levels of precision to ensure the right price is defined between the buyer and the supplier.</p>
                <p id="78ac" data-selectable-paragraph="">To help explain the concept of unit price, we will walk through a simple example of painting a room, using fake numbers, in this article.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p id="eec3" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Our Example:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Paint a 500 square foot room with premium paint with 20% of the work being at a tall height.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                </blockquote>
                <h2 id="fd41" data-selectable-paragraph="">Preparing for a Unit Price Contract:</h2>
                <p id="b6e0" data-selectable-paragraph="">Prior to the request fo<span id="rmm">r</span><span>&nbsp;</span>work, the buyer and supplier define a “catalog” of units, typically leveraging specific industry standards, with as much granularity as necessary for both parties. They can also define specific scenarios where the price may fluctuate based on material, situational, or location-based conditions and factors.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p id="cb8f" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Unit Price catalog governing the engagement defines the following: to paint 1 unit of wall (1 unit = 100 square feet), it would take 1 hour. With a crew rate of $20 per hour, the base unit rate would be $20 per 100 square feet of wall painted. By including the use of premium grade paint, we would multiply the base rate by a factor amount (1.2). We also noted that 20% of the 500 square feet, or 100 square feet, would be at a height adding another factor of 1.1 times the base rate.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p id="f41b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Based on the catalog definitions of base units, crew rates, and factors, calculating the estimated prices of the engagement is relatively simple.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p id="a333" data-selectable-paragraph="">Unit Rate 1= $20 base rate * 1.2 (premium grade paint) = $24 per unit</p>
                <p id="99cb" data-selectable-paragraph="">Unit Price 2 = $20 base rate * 1.2 (premium grade paint) * 1.1 (height) = $26.40 per unit</p>
                <p id="1709" data-selectable-paragraph="">Invoice Amount Payable to Contractor = ($24 * 4 units to paint) + $26.40 * 1 unit to paint) = $122.40 for 500 square feet</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                </blockquote>
                <h2 id="4970" data-selectable-paragraph="">Why would you use a Unit Price contracting strategy?</h2>
                <p id="e6e2" data-selectable-paragraph="">As noted above, the Unit Price contracting strategy is best utilized when the work can be defined in blocks, or units, of work. Leveraging this approach makes it simple to compare the crew rate and base units across various supplier during the selection process. It also make scope changes easier to define and manage over fixed fee contracts based on the catalog that helps to define the work estimates.</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h2 id="741d" data-selectable-paragraph="">What are the challenges of Unit Price Contracts?</h2>
                <p id="89ab" data-selectable-paragraph="">While our above example was simple, the uses of the Unit Price contract can become complicated. For example, in some cases, the initially scoped work may not cover the needs of the specific engagement or a required function may not be defined specifically in the catalog. As a result, the final cost of the engagement is not defined from the beginning and is unknown.</p>
                <p id="7999" data-selectable-paragraph="">Second, suppliers need to measure the number of units completed for billing purposes. Additionally, the buying organization needs to validate that those units are completed and meet the quality requirements before payment is issued.</p>
                <p id="9a6a" data-selectable-paragraph="">Finally, the Unit Price approach can tend to lead to unbalanced bids where, according to<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cohenseglias.com/contracting-database/unbalanced-bidding/#:~:text=Unbalanced%20bidding%20is%20where%20a,in%20a%20unit%20price%20contract." rel="noopener nofollow">Cohen Seglias,<span>&nbsp;</span></a>a “bidder places a high price on some items and a low price on other items in a unit price contract.”</p>
                <p data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
                <h2 id="15f3" data-selectable-paragraph="">What can help me manage Unit Price Contracts?</h2>
                <p id="136d" data-selectable-paragraph="">The first suggestion is to clearly defined a unit price catalog when leveraging a Unit Price contract. Defining a detailed hierarchy can help with estimation as well as soliciting the same details across contractors for selection purposes.</p>
                <p id="7fdf" data-selectable-paragraph="">Second, consider leveraging a Contractor Management Software, such as<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener">TRACK</a>. While the strategy is based on units of work completed on a given time scale which TRACK supports, leveraging a site’s Proof of Presence solution, or a mobile alternative, can help to provide the historical data to help with validating costs and scoping efforts in the future.</p>
                <p id="d01c" data-selectable-paragraph="">Finally, understand the work to be completed at your company that may benefit from leveraging a Unit Price contract. If your company does leverage this strategy, it is important to not overlook the importance of ensuring that the work completed aligns to the required quality standard before issuing payment.</p>

                <p><em>Management Controls, Inc. launches a new Rental Equipment Module in the latest TRACK Software Release.</em></p>
                <p><!--more--><span></span></p>
                <h2><span>Rental Equipment Module</span></h2>
                <p><span>We are excited to announce the release of our new Rental Equipment Module in the <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0600ff;">TRACK Platform</span></a> this month!</span><span>&nbsp;We understand that managing Rental Equipment can become difficult due to contractual needs, and the need to use a separate billing process. These challenges can lead to a lack of confidence in the calculation for the rate being charged and potential value leakage.<br><br></span>We are now able to bridge the gap with our new Rental Equipment Module in TRACK! The new module supports Rental Equipment contractual terms and conditions in an easy-to-use solution to drive cost savings by:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Ensuring accurate rates are applied to rental equipment based on rented time for initial or swapped equipment,</li>
                <li>Identifying excessive spend on bulk items,</li>
                <li>Reducing the cost of third-party mark-ups for rented equipment, and</li>
                <li>Reducing master data entry time due to the purpose-built solution</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This solution gives customers the ability to track any kind of equipment, and services spend, in one place allowing you to make better business decisions.&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="font-weight: normal;">You may be wondering, what is the difference between the Equipment Module in TRACK and the new Rental Equipment Module? <span>The Equipment Module in TRACK is where you can track the equipment that is <span style="font-weight: bold;">owned by vendors</span> that they </span><span>use for your project and charge you for that use. Rental Equipment Module is where you can track equipment </span><span>from a <span style="font-weight: bold;">third-party equipment supplier</span>. Rental Equipment is typically used by both the owner company and the </span><span>vendor.</span></p>
                <br>
                <h2>Why utilize the Rental Equipment Module?</h2>
                <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Easily Validate Rates for Rental Equipment</h3>

                <h3><span>​</span></h3>
                <h3 style="font-size: 20px;"><span data-contrast="auto">Rental Equipment Data Automation</span></h3>

                <p><span style="color: #222222;">Due to the pandemic &amp; ensuing global uncertainty, heavy industry reduced maintenance and capital spending by as much as 30% in addition to creating remote work arrangements for many employees. Organizations that used manual contractor spend processes were extremely challenged by this forced digital transition. Now, companies must transform digitally to survive, the motto of the future certainly is “survival of the digitally fit.”</span></p>
                <p><span style="color: #222222;">Companies are working on this digital transformation in one of two ways, via internal “homegrown” digital projects or through strategic partnerships with technology suppliers like MCi. Unfortunately, companies often struggle through years of fruitless internally developed solutions that rarely deliver concrete financial results. Additionally, the costs of internally developed applications are difficult to accurately calculate with IT back-charging business units for digitization support. However, when companies digitize their contractor spend processes using tools like the</span><span> <a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track#:~:text=The%20TRACK%C2%AE%20Platform%20delivers%20an%20automated%20process%20to,your%20contractors%20agree%20on%20%28daily%29%20before%20authorizing%20payment."><span style="color: #954f72;"><span style="color: #0600ff;">TRACK® Platform</span></span></a></span><span style="color: #222222;">, they have five key benefits:</span></p>

                <p><span style="color: #222222;">For these reasons, the world's largest heavy industry firms have chosen the TRACK Platform to digitally manage their contractor spend, especially for significant routine <span style="color: #0600ff;"><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/maintenance" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color: #0600ff;">maintenance</a></span> events and large projects such as <span style="color: #0600ff;"><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/shutdown-turnaround-outage" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color: #0600ff;">Shuts, Turnarounds, and Outages</a></span> (STOs). While it is possible to manage these high-spend events using “free” software like Excel, Microsoft Project, and SharePoint; the costs quickly add up. Building new processes for each STO, manual data transfers, complex formulas, ad hoc business processes, reporting delays, corrupted files, etc. With the recent reduction in spend, each maintenance dollar counts even more, so spend it on a proven STO cost management software.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
                <p><span style="color: #222222;">Over the past 30+ years, MCi has worked with heavy industry to digitize the software functions that matter most preparing and executing STOs, even if the support staff is remote. During the coronavirus pandemic, <span style="color: #0600ff;"><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/our-customers" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color: #0600ff;">Customers</a></span> using the TRACK Platform were able to remotely manage over $300M in STO spend seamlessly.

                <div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1562100470710_20033">
                <p>What does “daily cost transparency” mean? How about, "having actionable knowledge today of yesterday’s activities performed by internal (employees) and contractor resources and the costs to your project.” Another way of thinking about it is the phrase, “driving ahead looking through the windshield rather than the rearview mirror.”</p>
                <p>We all have been criticized by bosses for making important spur-of-the-moment project decisions that came back to bite us. Discovery work/project scope additions that we hoped would fit into the total project budget. Contingency costs, weather delays, which blew out the project’s contingency budget (if any). And your favorite, contractor invoices that show up on your desk three months after the project is closed; after you've told everyone what the final costs were!&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We all know that STO planning and scheduling work needs to begin months or years prior to Day 1 of the turnaround. That’s equally true for contract negotiations and contract signing. It's also true for the dozens of other important pre-turnaround activities (permits, engineering, and long lead time acquisitions). The truth is that all the important pre-turnaround work which has such a dramatic impact on turnaround execution is inter-dependent and in pretty constant flux. When one domino falls, another domino is sure to fall.</p>
                <p>Turnarounds, Shutdowns, and Outages move forward at light speed. Good information about actual hours worked by activity and the costs of those resources (labor, equipment, materials, per diem) is never fast enough to stay up with the project. You end up doing the best you can but making decisions based on old, incomplete project hours and costs. Decisions that are often the best you can do but now good enough. There is a better way.</p>

                <h3><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">Daily Cost Transparency</span></h3>
                <div><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">It is possible to capture highly accurate hours worked, by PO/Line Item and Work Order, Operation, and Sub-Operation. Hours that are verified by your security/access control system and are calculated using the terms and conditions of each contract. Actual hours are monetized by the contractual craft rates for straight time, overtime, and double time. All of these calculations, hours, and contract-specific costs, for labor, equipment and materials can be determined as each contract craftsman exits your facility. That’s real-time. </span><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">The hours and costs can then be allocated to PO/WO’s so that your project gets a next-day update of burned hours and actual costs. The burned hours can be forwarded to your planning and scheduling system(s) so everyone is in the loop on activity status (percent complete) and earned values can be calculated. Earned values that are calculated using honest-to-goodness actual hours not “best guess” hours as are so often reported from the field on paper timesheets and compiled in excel spreadsheets.</span></div>

                <p>With actual burned hours by PO/WO, it’s absolutely possible to update the latest estimate of project total cost and duration. Most turnaround projects are comprised of many PO/WO packages. Tracking the real progress of PO/WO’s and real costs of work allows you to upgrade the quality of the estimate every day. Your “new daily forecast” is then based on the highest quality components possible and your new forecast allows you to answer definitively that age-old question: <em><span style="font-weight: normal;">“When are you going to finish and what’s it going to cost?”</span></em></p>

                <div data-block-type="23"><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">Financial controls are fundamental to most companies’ risk management programs. When companies are dependent on external providers for goods and services required for daily operations, it is essential that financial controls are designed and policies implemented. With the right financial controls and disciplined adherence to processes, </span><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="color: #33475b;"><span style="color: #666666;">contractor</span></span>&nbsp;</span>invoices will reflect what has been earned, down to the penny. Within audits, a common financial control finding is failure to follow contractor time-keeping processes. Example findings are:</span></div>
                </div>
                </div>
                <ul>
                <li>Invoiced work hours exceeded approved hours in the contractor time system (CTS)</li>
                <li>No work hours in the CTS to validate invoice</li>
                <li>CTS work hours approved after invoice already paid</li>
                </ul>
                <div>
                <p>Companies using MCi’s <span style="color: #0600ff;"><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color: #0600ff;">TRACK® Platform</a></span> have eliminated audit findings like those above. To prevent discrepancies between invoiced hours and CTS hours, TRACK users are effectively employing poka-yoke. Poka-yoke is a Japanese term common in lean manufacturing circles and is defined as the use of any automatic device or method that either makes it impossible for an error to occur or makes the error immediately obvious once it has occurred.</p>
                <p>TRACK data is a true accounting of the hours a contractor spends at the <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">work location as provided directly from a company’s access control system (ACS). The <span style="color: #666666;">contractor</span> and company have agreed to use badge-in/badge-out events as the single metho</span>d for the measurement of time on-site. If workers are off-site in remote locations, companies leverage our <span style="color: #0600ff;"><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track-anywhere" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color: #0600ff;">mobile technology</a></span> to capture activity.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Contractors and owners no longer have to estimate time and manually prepare timesheets. Companies no longer need to enter time data into a separate CTS. Instead, there is a single view of <span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #666666;">contractor&nbsp;</span>hours in TRACK. This single view not only eliminates time-intensive, error-prone manual timekeeping but also effectively eliminates invoice time discrepancies. Owners and contractors have the same view of contract labor and equipment time daily and sometimes even on a shift-by-shift basis.</p>

                <h2><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">Contract Visibility and Consistent Application</span></h2>
                <p><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">Another common audit finding is discovering that invoices are routinely paid even though they do not comply with Contract Rates, Terms, and Conditions. Applying the correct, contractually allowed multipliers to hours worked sounds straightforward. The challenge is that each invoice likely contains dozens of labor classifications, shift schedules, and pay rates.</span></p>
                <p><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">Knowing and consistently applying all of these variables is complex. Yet for many companies, </span><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #666666;">contractor&nbsp;</span>billing and company invoice approval processes are manual. First, the contractor’s billing department is expected to apply all of the Rates, Terms, and Conditions correctly as the invoice is prepared. Then the company’s approver needs to evaluate the invoice for accuracy keeping all of those same conditions in mind.</span></p>
                <p><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">Using this traditional, manual approach, the </span><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"><span style="color: #666666; background-color: #ffffff;">contractor</span>&nbsp;may not present an invoice to the company for days or more often weeks. By then, the company is effectively approving payments for goods and services in the dark; as approvers cannot remember details from days or weeks in the past. Consider that some companies report approving a million or more invoices every year and ensuring invoicing accuracy becomes almost humanly impossible. It is no surprise that lack of compliance with financial controls is often a repeat audit finding.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"></span></p>
                <div>&nbsp;</div>
                <h2>Consistent Payment of Accurate Invoices</h2>
                <div>MCi’s decades of experience indicate that companies save 5% to 15% of contracted services costs when they consistently pay vendors according to the Terms and Conditions in their contract. For companies that rely on hundreds or thousands of contract employees every day, the savings can add up to millions of dollars, annually.</div>
                <div><br>For TRACK users, the secret to capturing these cost savings and maintaining compliance with financial controls processes is to automate the application of contract Rates, Terms, and Conditions to work hours. This automation reduces the probability, perhaps to zero, of human errors such as:</div>

                <div>Billable hours are calculated by automatically applying pay formulas with correct terms and conditions to the worker's scheduled shift and the ACS data. Then the total invoice amount is calculated by applying the correct labor and equipment rates to those hours. Invoices are more accurate for two reasons. Rates, Terms, and Conditions are correctly and consistently applied and company approvers receive Track timesheets sooner, closer to the actual delivery of goods and services. Some companies <span style="color: #0600ff;"><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/our-customers" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color: #0600ff;">using TRACK</a></span> pay their contractors every single day and can take advantage of early-pay discounts.&nbsp;</div>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <div>Today’s modern workforce may contain more contract workers than company employees. The value of consistently paying contractors accurately can be worth millions of dollars every year and contribute significantly to improved operational efficiency. Developing the capability to consistently deliver accurate payments is difficult or impossible if the payment process is a heavily human-dependent process. Humans cannot effectively measure time on the worksite for hundreds or thousands of individual contractors nor can they remember and apply all of the contract Rates, Terms and Conditions to hundreds or thousands of invoices, consistently.</div>
                <div><br>Since 1989, MCi has a proven track record of integrating with companies’ existing ACS and ERP systems to automate dependable and consistent processes to ensure that contractors are paid exactly what they have earned.&nbsp;<span style="color: #0600ff;"></span></div>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4><span data-contrast="auto">Real-Time Contractor Fatigue Monitoring</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h4>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Safety discussions &amp; safety incidents most often&nbsp;occur out in the field, away from the desk. Get</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">the safety data you need when you’re out there talking with your Contractors and Supervisors. Start your contractor interactions with a quality safety interaction. Discussion &amp; real-time and meaningful metrics to improve your site’s safety performance. The conversation changes when you’re on the go and “in the know”.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <h4><span data-contrast="auto">Analyzing the Impact of Off-Contract Work</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h4>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Off contract work (Overrides) is a key area of value leakage and often the topic for contractor improvement discussions. It’s hard to find time to analyze the details. Whether you’re in a meeting with a supplier or in a hallway conversation with a supervisor, the mobile-optimized override analytics give you quick access to the information you need to quantify the value of off-contract work &amp; identify savings opportunities.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <h4><span data-contrast="auto">Premium Time</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h4>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Labor is the primary cost driver in most companies' contracted spend. Premium time including OT and DT has a significant effect on burn rates and needs to be continuously monitored. When making the morning rounds in the field Supervisors can review the top contributors to Premium time costs and make course corrections. Quickly identify these vendors and individuals pushing up costs and make sure they understand company expectations.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <h4><span data-contrast="auto">Contractor Spend Cycle Time</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h4>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Ensuring your TRACK Process cycle times stay low is critical to maximizing savings. When the</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">time between work being performed, allocated, and authorized increases, vendors can miss allocate, authorizers can approve costs without a clear memory of what actually happened. Quickly access these cycle times to continually stay on top of your TRACK process performance.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <h4><span data-contrast="auto">Itemized&nbsp;Contractor&nbsp;Materials &amp; Equipment</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h4>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Spending on Equipment &amp; Material is typically less than Labor, however, value leakage consistently occurs. Equipment &amp; Material spend can have significant issues at the item level.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Review the top 5 Equipment &amp; Material items for the past 7 days to identify anomalies in these</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">categories and take action to investigate and escalate.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <h4><span data-contrast="auto">Contractor Cost Savings Opportunities</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h4>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">TRACK consistently delivers cost savings and operational visibility across all Vendors.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">This cost savings opportunity can be missed&nbsp;or forgotten for Vendors that have not yet been&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">added to the TRACK Platform. This mobile view of Non-TRACK Vendors shows you the expected</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">savings you can achieve simply by onboarding a new Vendor.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <h4><span data-contrast="auto">Automatically Collect Contractor Headcount</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h4>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Having the right headcount for the day is essential to completing the scheduled work,</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">ensuring adequate supervision, and managing project costs. No more waiting on emailed lists of</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">“Headcount” from Vendors. You can now easily&nbsp;review Headcount, companies, and names of&nbsp;individuals, right from your mobile phone!</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <h4><span data-contrast="auto">Evaluate&nbsp;Contractor Supervision&nbsp;Ratios</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h4>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Proper Supervision Ratios are key to maximizing productivity across your operations. Too few supervisors can reduce craft productivity, increase safety risks and lead to poor quality work. Too many supervisors add an unnecessary additional cost.

                <p><em>Management Controls, Inc. launches user improvements in the latest software release.</em></p>
                <p><!--more--><span></span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">We are excited to announce new user efficiency updates added into the Track Platform this month! </span><span data-contrast="auto">We are always working to identify problems our customers are having while using TRACK and strive to improve the user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <h3>Updates &amp; Changes</h3>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">TRACK's August release aims to highlight User Efficiency - emphasizing updates on Imports (Other Cost Import, Transit Time Import, Import Status Visibility) and Agreement Document Overview.</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Watch the video below to learn more about the release from our Sr. Product Manager of Track, Anna Van Cleef!</span></p>
                {% video_player "embed_player" overrideable=False, type='scriptV4', hide_playlist=True, viral_sharing=False, embed_button=False, autoplay=False, hidden_controls=False, loop=False, muted=False, full_width=True, width='800', height='450', player_id='53058103926', style='' %}
                <h4 style="font-size: 24px;">&nbsp;</h4>
                <h4 style="font-size: 24px;"><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Blog%20Images%20-%20December_Credits.jpg" alt="Blog Images - December_Credits" width="1280" loading="lazy" style="width: 1280px;"></h4>
                <h4>Other Cost Import</h4>
                <p><span>Managing regularly scheduled other costs, such as per diem, for labor resources can be a time consuming process without a simply way to update many resources at the same time. </span>With the newly released updates, TRACK provides the ability to assign and un-assign costs for labor resources in mass, which improves efficiencies during other changes.&nbsp;<br><span data-ccp-props="{}"></span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>Transit Time Report</h4>
                <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #58595b;">TRACK users can now leverage imports to improve efficiency in managing Transit Time Devices. Being able to define the allowable time when traveling from gate to gate within a facility is a time-consuming process for locations with different gates. TRACK now supports managing the Transit Time via an import, which creates and updates data in mass improving overall efficiency.</span></p>
                <p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <h4><span data-contrast="auto">Import Status Visibility</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h4>
                <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #58595b;">Validating the status of an import required the user to click on a log file to see whether it was successful or had errors. With this release, users can see if their import had errors or was successful without looking into the log file.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <h4 style="font-size: 24px;"><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Blog%20Images%20-%20December_Authorization%20Enhancements.jpg" alt="Blog Images - December_Authorization Enhancements" width="1280" loading="lazy" style="width: 1280px;"></h4>
                <h4>Validation of Contractual Terms</h4>
                <p><span>During the review of completed work, field based personnel may not have a clear understanding of the requirements within an agreement to ensure that specific requests meet contractual requirements. In the latest release, we added functionality&nbsp;to enable sourcing and procurement professionals to load the Agreement or an Agreement Overview sheet into TRACK, which will be available for Track Authorizers to review during the authorization review file.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><em>M</em><em>anagement Controls, Inc. adds badge in and badge out alerts to TRACK Anywh</em><em>ere Virtual Gate.</em></p>
                <p><!--more--><span></span>One of the core values at Management Controls, Inc. is to create continuous value for our customers. We noticed that workers in remote worksites using TRACK Anywhere Virtual Gate often forget to badge in or out on their mobile devices. This leads to less accurate data for the project as a whole. We have now added the functionality for users to set alerts to remind them to badge in and badge out of a worksite. The goal with this update is that workers will have one less thing to remember while focusing on their project and in turn, the data around the project will be much more accurate with actual time, schedule, and costs.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Badge In/Out Alerts</h3>
                <p>TRACK Anywhere users can now enable alerts to remind them to badge in and badge out. These alerts are easy to set up and function like any other native alert on an iOS or Android device. The new feature also allows for several alerts at different times to be configured then turned on or off depending on a worker's schedule for that week.</p>

With Virtual Gate, contractors can add field notes and images to provide owners visibility of the work being done in the field. All Virtual Gate activity includes GPS coordinates that are used with geo-boundaries and validation of worker location. The activities from Virtual Gate flow into TRACK as labor activity along with the geo-information, field notes, and images giving owners information necessary to accurately approve.</p>
                <p>Virtual Gate consists of a mobile application (iPhone &amp; Android) and an administrative console as a cloud application that communicates with the client’s TRACK database. The application can be used by individuals or by a foreman to record the daily activity of their crew members.</p>

                <p><em>Management Controls, Inc. deploys User Experience Improvements in the October Release.</em></p>
                <p><!--more--><span></span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">W<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">e are excited to announce new user experience improvements added to the <span style="color: #33475b;">TRACK </span>Platform this month!&nbsp;</span></span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">We are always working to identify problems our customers are having while using TRACK and strive to improve the user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Timesheet Reprocessing</span></h3>
                <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">On occasion, for customers leveraging integrations between <span style="color: #33475b;">TRACK </span>and their ERP Systems, <span style="color: #33475b;">TRACK </span>timesheets are sent by <span style="color: #33475b;">TRACK </span>but not received by the ERP for a variety of reasons.</span></p>
                <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">In this release, users with the correct permissions will be able to reprocess these stuck timesheets without MCi assistance.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: normal;"><em>Watch the video above for an overview of the latest release from our Sr. Product Manager of Track, Anna Van Cleef!</em></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Standardization of Date Formats</h3>
                <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">As users leverage imports to add or update information in mass users were not able to utilize a consistent date format across the <span style="color: #33475b;">TRACK </span>imports causing frustration and work.</span></p>
                <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">In this release, we have updated the date format to be consistent across most imports. Ex.) Equipment Allocations import, New Equipment import, Equipment Utilization import, TrackInOutEvents impor</span>t, TrackUser import. For the specific date format requirements for these <em><span style="font-weight: normal;">and</span></em> other imports, please reach out to MCi’s Support team or your MCi Account Manager for a copy of the Track Import File Layout document.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Insights Spotlight: Fatigue Management</h3>
                <p>Do you struggle to track worker fatigue? With Insights-as-a-Service you can automatically identify fatigue breaches and respond in real-time. The fatigue dashboard reduces site safety incidents by providing real-time fatigue compliance exceptions for onsite resources.</p>
                <p><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/fatigue-100.jpg" alt="Fatigue Management" width="575" loading="lazy" style="width: 575px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"></p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Fatigue Compliance Dashboard&nbsp;</em></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Previous Release Spotlight: Authorization Reassignment&nbsp;</h3>
                <p>Have you ever had to wait for an Authorizer to return from vacation to continue the daily settlement process? In August 2020, MCi released the Authorization Reassignment feature that enables TRACK users to temporarily reassign authorizations pro-actively to a different supervisor (Area ID).</p>
                <p>This enhancement will help to keep the daily settlement process flowing while TRACK Authorizers are out of the office! This release allows Authorizers and TRACK Coordinators to reassign authorizations to different IDs for a set date range to ensure continuation without delays.</p>

                <h2>User Productivity</h2>
                <p>When TRACK administrators assign areas to users within their organization, it is time-consuming to scroll through a long list to find a specific Area ID. We added the ability to search for an Area ID in TrackAdmin to improve user productivity when creating <span style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">user accounts, updating a user's access to certain areas, and managing the area groups.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><em>Compare Key Performance Metrics across your Enterprise Operations&nbsp;</em></p>
                <p><!--more--><span></span></p>
                <p>Management Controls Inc. (MCi), the global leader in contractor spend management, continues to innovate with the launch of their Enterprise Benchmarking offering that enables customers to compare key contractor performance metrics across all enterprise locations. The intelligent platform automatically gathers and standardizes key TRACK Platform KPIs to highlight best practices, uncovering Commercial, Operational, and Business Process value opportunities.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent40.net/hubfs/6486746/Premium%20TIme@2x.png" alt="Premium Time Hours &amp; Costs" width="500" loading="eager" style="width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>MCi’s TRACK Platform provides business owners with a comprehensive automated software solution for managing contractor labor, equipment, and materials costs across their enterprise, with proven delivery of 5% to 15% reduction in contractor costs. For over 30 years, companies across a broad range of industries including, Oil &amp; Gas, Metals &amp; Mining, Pulp &amp; Paper, Power Generation, Chemicals, Construction, and Manufacturing have relied on the TRACK Platform to automate contract compliance, eliminate invoice disputes, and prevent erroneous billing. Now, with the addition of Enterprise Benchmarking, companies are driving contractor management excellence across their entire portfolio of sites.</p>
                <p>Enterprise Benchmarking enables customers to understand the performance of contractors holistically throughout their enterprise with powerful analytics including Premium Time Hours &amp; Costs, Off-Contract Charges &amp; Cost Impacts, and Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Cycle times. The interactive benchmarking offering enables customers to see the strategic level of a KPI for all sites and then drill down into individual contractor trends across sites to identify the root cause of under or over performance.</p>
                <p>“Enterprise Benchmarking is a huge leap forward for organizations seeking portfolio-wide standardization and performance improvements. Benchmarking contractor activity uncovers value and drives collaboration as sites share best practices.” <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">– MCi President, Ken Naughton</span></p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">This service is truly plug-and-play. No templates, no data gathering, and no interviews are required to get your enterprise up and running. Enterprise Benchmarking delivers full transparency of common KPIs from each location based on 6+ months of your detailed TRACK data. With Enterprise Benchmarking, TRACK sites can instantly collaborate on improvement plans and monitor the impact of improvements as the KPIs are automatically updated.</p>

                <p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #58595b;">In this release, we have made enhancements to the rejected allocation process in TRACK&nbsp;for Vendor Timekeepers to easily identify rejected allocations and take the appropriate actions.</span></p>

                <h3>Cost Object Status Visibility</h3>
                <p>Before this release, Cost Objects that are inactive or have past their effective date are not clearly indicated when during the Authorization process when the customer wants to prevent authorizing charges to cost objects in those states.</p>
                <p>In this release, we have updated the authorization pages so that they display the status of the cost object leveraging familiar methods for Authorizers, based on settings enabled, so Authorizers have the necessary settings enabled.</p>

We are proud to be one of over 40 speakers presenting at this conference.&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Here are the key topics from the Future of Mining Australia website:</p>
                <h4><span>DIGITAL MINE</span></h4>
                <p><span>You do not have the budget to buy an endless number of new technologies, let alone the time to integrate them all into your existing infrastructure. Our agenda will address the benefits and challenges of each technology so you leave with a new focus on which to prioritize to maximize your operations.</span></p>
                <h4><span>LEADERS IN MINING</span></h4>
                <p><span>Future of Mining Australia is the meeting point for mining strategists and decision-makers. Hear from the C-suite who will share technology breakthroughs, application success stories, and core challenges.</span></p>
                <h4><span>ESG 360</span></h4>
                <p><span>The pressure on mining companies to reduce their carbon footprint and install a culture of sustainability has never been so intense. Our program will explore the pathways to building successful sustainability strategies today, which will evolve to suit future generations.</span></p>

                <h3>Revokes &amp; Credits Enhancements</h3>
                <p>Before this release, our Revoke and Credit functionality was intended to provide productivity gains for users and enable TRACK Coordinators and Authorizers to spend less time doing rework when mistakes are made. We have observed this functionality wasn't fully meeting these goals and caused frustration for users.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In this release, we have enhanced the Revoke and Credit functionality in TRACK to:</p>

                <h2>Dear TRACK University</h2>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Dear TRACK U,</p>
                <p>The 13.3 Load Report Criteria course speaks about the load report criteria being added to the drop-down list. However, you have to leave the screen and come back or create a new report to trigger the drop-down list to update. It does not automatically refresh.</p>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>

                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Dear TRACK U User,</p>
                <p>Thank you for posting this finding. This is a bug for the version you are using which is 6.5.19.31. I tested this functionality with my TRACK environment which is the 6.5.20.4 version. This issue should be fixed with the April 2022 Release where users will see the recently saved and loaded report name in the Load Report Criteria drop-down list.</p>
                <p>Thank you for posting this. We encourage you to inquire about any TRACK University course here in our forum. We appreciate you!</p>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>

However, due to the accuracy and visibility of Track, it is beneficial to have lump sum projects as well.

This allows you to compare lump sum versus time and materials for future work, incorporate costs into Insights reporting, and have one place for Authorizers to approve all costs.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <section>
                <div>So far, 2023 is delivering more than the usual number of planned plant turnarounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Case in point: At least 15 U.S. oil refineries plan maintenance ranging from two to 11 weeks through May, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/heavy-slate-us-oil-refinery-overhauls-crimp-fuel-output-2023-01-18/" style="font-style: normal;" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reuters</a>.</div>
                <div>&nbsp;</div>
                <div>Maintenance work will be heaviest at refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast. That’s a lot of craft labor, equipment, and materials to keep track of onsite.&nbsp;</div>
                <div><span style="font-style: normal;">&nbsp;</span></div>
                <div><span style="font-style: normal;">Planned overhauls this quarter will likely be the highest in five years, according to analysts. This is partly due to the need to catch up on maintenance after record utilization in 2022 and refiners scaling back maintenance in 2020 and 2021 because of COVID.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
                <div><span style="font-style: normal;">&nbsp;</span></div>
                <div><span style="font-style: normal;">Whether you work at a refinery, petrochemical plant, power plant, or pulp and paper mill, having thousands of specialists and contractors coming onsite to perform scheduled maintenance on equipment and operations is expensive.</span></div>
                <div><span style="font-style: normal;">&nbsp;</span></div>
                <div>For refineries, these overhauls mean less fuel production. During planned outages this Spring, data provider <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/heavy-slate-us-oil-refinery-overhauls-crimp-fuel-output-2023-01-18/" style="font-style: normal;" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IIR</a> said U.S. refiners would drop some 1.4 million barrels per day or processing capacity, double the five-year average.&nbsp;</div>

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Despite uncertainty and vulnerabilities around everything from the supply chain to climate change, the global petrochemical market is still expected to see </span><span data-contrast="none">a compound annual growth rate (</span><a href="https://www.bicmagazine.com/industry/refining-petrochem/2023-Industry-Outlook/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">CAGR) of 4.9%</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> between now and 2026. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Downstream end-use products include plastics, packing, medical equipment, detergents, tires, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, automotive, and construction.

                <p><span data-contrast="none">In fact, the International Monetary Fund predicted a gloomy and uncertain outlook for 2023. Nonetheless, demand for end-use products will put pressure on downstream companies to increase production capacity.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">When you dig into what is occurring downstream today – the buzzwords often include circularity, transformation, decarbonization, sustainability, supply chains, and resilience.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">There’s a lot to unpack under each of these terms. But to dig into the big picture, we turned to a report by Reuters, </span><a href="https://1.reutersevents.com/LP=33906" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><i><span data-contrast="none">North American Downstream Trends Report</span></i></a><i><span data-contrast="none">.&nbsp;</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">They point to emerging trends and challenges surrounding capital projects (CapEx); reliability and maintenance; and shutdowns and turnarounds. Let’s take a closer look at these three areas:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> <img src="https://6486746.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/6486746/Stock%20Photos/Stock%20images/Equipment%20Picking%20Up%20dirt.jpg" alt="Equipment Picking Up dirt" width="612" height="541" loading="lazy" style="height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 612px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"></span></p>

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Many factors have combined to cause delays in downstream capital expenditures (CapEx) projects. These include a combination of global events, project delays, labor shortages, and reduced CapEx availability, according to Reuters.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">However, by 2025, the total global energy sector CapEx is projected to increase by 18% compared to the 2016-to-2020 period, according to S&amp;P Global.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">While much of the growth will be in transmission and distribution spending ($433 billion), renewables ($367 billion), and oil and gas ($209 billion), they see global downstream CapEx to grow in the second half of the decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Meanwhile, </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/capital-investment-is-about-to-surge-are-your-operations-ready" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">McKinsey</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is pointing to a general boom in capital projects.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">McKinsey believes the world will see “a once-in-a-lifetime wave of capital spending on physical assets between now and 2027. This investment surge —amounting to roughly $130 trillion—will flood into projects to decarbonize and renew critical infrastructure.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">What are some of the potential headwinds?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">A significant downstream CapEx project risk stems from on-site problems, such as labor shortages that can lead to delays and cost overruns.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">One way to reduce these risks is to complete as much of the project as possible offsite. For example, constructing prefabricated modules offsite.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Reuters cites an ExxonMobil-SABIC joint venture plant in Texas that maintained construction throughout COVID by using offsite-built modules to cut the on-site workforce by half.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">No doubt, tech tools—from software platforms to AI—can also play a role in improving CapEx execution. For example, many will use plant camera feeds to spot safety and compliance violations.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">AI is used to review video footage and, within seconds, spot violations, such as workers without hard hats and safety gear. By using automatic detection systems, companies can rely on technology instead of manually reviewing video footage.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/capital-investment-is-about-to-surge-are-your-operations-ready" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">McKinsey</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> notes how CapEx planning is transformed with advanced analytics. They urge companies to use these tools at every stage—from planning to real-time process tracking. They use the example of an oil and gas company using AI-based analytics to forecast project duration and identify high-risk activity for a project that was delayed more than a year.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">In fact, predictive maintenance systems can detect 90% of faults up to five months before failure with a 200% typical ROI for the equipment, according to the failure detection technology provider Samotics.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">There is growing interest in adopting such systems downstream as part of wider moves to use technology for improved maintenance and reliability. “One of the things that we’re trying to do better is to use technology right to improve our processes,” said Jimmy Jernigan, assistant director of global maintenance and reliability at LyondellBasell, during a Downstream USA 2022 panel discussion.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">During COVID, it became clear how maintenance strategies impacted resilience.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">At the time, there was a concern about maintaining operations with reduced workforces and restrictive working conditions. Today,&nbsp; this has grown to include cybersecurity worries.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">For example, the 2021 ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline highlighted the danger of the industrial infrastructure being targeted by cybercriminals. The incident impacted consumers and airlines along the U.S. East Coast.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">While digitization can help make downstream companies more resilient, technology can also address new requirements around transparency and accountability.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">This means technology is not just improving how fast work can get done, but also ensuring accuracy. Workers can digitally capture data with handheld devices, sensors, cameras, and drones. But this real-time data must be optimized so it can have an impact on improving operations and maintenance strategies.</span></p>

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Downstream shutdown and turnaround activities have been hampered by many challenges in recent years—from acquiring materials like gaskets and control valves to a tight skilled labor market. Post-COVID concerns and the war in Ukraine only complicated things.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">With over 50% of turnarounds going over budget, procurement departments have had to get creative—from safeguarding supplies to searching for alternative vendors.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">McKinsey points out how problematic the skilled labor market is today. They note that </span><span data-contrast="none">41 percent of the current U.S. construction workforce is expected to retire by 2031, and construction wage trends far exceed recent rates.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Many downstream players use change programs to improve project planning and minimize delays and cost overruns. With stronger owner-supplier relationships, they are more capable of delivering against expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">When it comes to turnaround decision-making, more businesses are turning to digital tools to help with scope determination, intervals and timing, product demand and supply, storage and inventory buildups, blocked-out months, spending profiles, and budgets, according to Reuters.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Data can also help deliver safer, more efficient, and more cost-effective turnarounds.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">When combined with external contractors on-site, the sheer number of tasks happening during a turnaround can dramatically increase the safety risk. When companies can harness real-time data, information, and analytics, they can improve their decision-making and deliver higher productivity.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">For example, former maintenance manager Bruce Grissom said he took a 31% productivity rate and improved it to about 50% using a </span><a href="/track-through-the-eyes-of-a-former-maintenance-manager" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">contractor spend management software</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, TRACK. One of the biggest benefits to using a digital solution was that he could identify skill levels every day and knowing “when the skill level 1 versus the skill level 4 ratio began to get out of proportion.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">If turnarounds aren’t just routine periodic maintenance events but increasingly large, complex projects, they must meet a broader range of objectives. These can include everything from providing a predictable cost and schedule performance to meeting regulatory targets to maintaining safety.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Many of these downstream trends and challenges will ultimately be solved using data and advanced analytics—especially when leveraging operational and safety-related data.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">It appears downstream operators are becoming more comfortable with the benefits digitization can deliver—especially around operational and safety-related data.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">By transitioning from traditional methods to digital solutions, Natalia Klafke, head of Radix Engineering and Software’s North American energy business, notes that some players have begun fusing digital and engineering knowledge for everything from feedstock supply decisions to creating a virtual control tower equipped with AI.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Now, think of how much project scope creeps out of its initial bounds when trying to manage each contractor relationship.

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">The answer?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">For starters, companies must build relationships, track expenditures, and have visibility into the effectiveness of the contractor workforce. Spreadsheets simply can’t capture the complexity of many contractor relationships on a granular level. Each contractor has multiple agreements, and each agreement has many different terms and conditions.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">When we asked the survey group to estimate annual contractor spend (including labor, equipment, and materials), more than 15% reported spending more than $100 million per year on contractor management with a full 23.5% spending $50 million or more.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Reining in spend and exerting capital discipline is a must for the mining industry. These survey results show just how important tighter contractor management controls are for better visibility into every vendor relationship.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Digging deeper into how the mining industry handles contractor management, MCi found the key pain points revolved around having the proper skill mix, manpower visibility, and staying within budget.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">As to the proper skill mix, we found a lack of visibility to be at the root of the conflict causing projects to go off course. Mining companies end up spinning their wheels. Even worse—think of the liability when a laborer is working at a site above their skill level along with added costs of unapproved skill step-ups.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">By aligning the interests of owners and contractors, McKinsey believes mining companies can ensure that the owner and contractor are working with each other as allies.

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Industrial sectors like mining are turning to technologies to drive efficiencies and improve owner-contractor relationships, according to Deloitte’s </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/energy-resources/us-eri-outlook-engineering-and-construction-2023.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span data-contrast="none">2023 Engineering &amp; Construction Industry Outlook</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">There is an urgency in mining to embrace tech—especially when trying to safely deliver mining projects on time and within budget. Many turn to tech solutions to boost profits by reducing costs and enhancing project execution. However, global supply chain disruptions, greater competition, worker shortages, and rising material prices point to tech as the antidote for improving productivity.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">For example, Deloitte shared how one industrial company used an all-in-one cloud-hosted software for end-to-end workflow estimation.

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Audits. They evoke fear. Apprehension. They’re also time-consuming and a drain on resources.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Still, they are the way of the world as senior management typically leans on audits to uncover financial savings, overbilling, and unused funds. If you work in a heavy asset industry like mining, chemicals, steelmaking, or pulp and paper, you’ve probably had to prepare or participate in an audit.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Satisfactory audit results are reassuring and confidence-building. Less than satisfactory findings create doubts about an organization, personal integrity, and capabilities. Exposing policy non-compliance can do more than bruise egos but limit careers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Why are vendor audits so important? For starters, they help to ensure suppliers and vendors operate in a manner that meets expectations and standards. By conducting vendor audits, you can identify potential risks and issues affecting operations and take steps to close those gaps or risks.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Globally, the mining industry is massive. As in $2 trillion big. And big mining implies big spending. Overall, the mining industry’s ongoing procurement spending amounts to around </span><a href="https://www.miningweekly.com/article/the-power-of-procurement-in-mining-2023-02-01" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0600ff; text-decoration: underline;">$200 billion annually</span></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">As a result, mining procurement is a key factor driving value for mining firms and their stakeholders. But it is difficult for the mining industry to get the procurement process right. Mining procurement is complex because of a variety of factors—from the instability in the global supply chain to pressure to deliver sustainable projects.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">For example, if you can’t access essential supplies, how do you scale production as demand for materials like copper and cobalt rises? Mining requires a wide range of equipment, supplies, and services that are often specialized and not widely available. This can limit the number of qualified suppliers and lead to higher costs and longer lead times.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">In addition, mining operations are often located in remote areas, requiring a complex network of suppliers and logistics providers to support their operations. This can make it challenging to manage and coordinate the flow of goods and services, leading to delays and increased costs.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">One way to keep from going over budget is to confirm payment according to exact terms and conditions.

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">With the right technology, mining companies can easily confirm whether contractors are adhering to all terms and conditions.

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Strong relationships with vendors are critical to success.

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Managing vendors require building relationships, tracking expenditures, and having visibility into the effectiveness of the contractor workforce. Spreadsheets simply can’t capture the complexity of many contractor relationships on a granular level.

                <p><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;">The root causes of some manufacturing woes are global. Think wars, pandemics, and supply chain disruptions. Others are more local—like a skilled labor shortage in your backyard. Mix in inflation and rising interest rates, and it becomes a perfect storm of uncertainty for everyone in manufacturing.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;">But some of these challenges are self-inflicted if plants and sites fail to embrace and implement digital automation tools. </span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;">The right digital automation tools—from cloud-based software to wearables—can make a night-and-day difference—especially in uncertain times.

Industry insiders point to a variety of labor issues—from a lack of qualified labor to out-of-control labor costs to poor work ethics. </span></p>
                <p style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 22.8pt; padding-left: 0in; font-size: 18px;"><span style="color: black;">“Demand for projects and skilled workers remains high and may even have intensified for skills required for massive manufacturing, infrastructure, and energy projects,” Ken Simonson, chief economist of the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC), told Reuters Events in April.</span></p>

                <p style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 22.8pt; padding-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;">From a safety perspective, sites must ensure employees and contractors coming onto job sites have been trained on the proper safety procedures and make sure they have the right PPE.</span></p>
                <p style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 22.8pt; padding-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;">How can plant managers, maintenance managers, turnaround managers, and procurement managers balance all the safety challenges on the sites they manage? With the right automation tools, operators can improve safety when they:</span></p>
                <ul>
                <li><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;">Know the location of all personnel to reduce muster time and ensure OSHA compliance in an emergency</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;">Eliminate safety blind spots and decrease time to safety by tracking equipment usage</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;">Get alerts when contractors are nearing their fatigue limit status</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 22.8pt; padding-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;">Instead of using digital automation tools, many project owners will rely on headcount and manpower reports. This can be dangerous from a safety perspective, but it also reduces visibility when managing budgets and cost savings.</span></p>
                <p style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 22.8pt; padding-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;">Consider who and what is involved in a typical outage or turnaround project:</span></p>
                <ul>
                <li><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;"> Dozens of contractor firms providing resources </span></li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;"> Thousands of open Purchase Orders/Work Orders/Activities </span></li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;"> 500-1,000 or more contract workers daily</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;"> Two to three shifts, operating seven days a week</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;">Beyond the safety issue, imagine not receiving the job progress and cost information until after the job is over. This is what happens when manufacturers fail to standardize processes and apply best practices with automation tools.</span></p>

                <p style="font-size: 18px;"><span style="color: #000000;">As described, many manufacturers will have hundreds or thousands of craftsmen with specific contract permutations coming on sites. Managing these contractors have traditionally been based on manual time methods, causing errors, disputes, lack of visibility, and control. </span></p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;"><span style="color: #000000;">By comparison, choosing to use digital tools can support these <a href="/contractor-management-best-practices" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;" rel="noopener" target="_blank">best practices</a>:</span></p>
                <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
                <li><span style="color: #000000;"> Using real-time metrics gives you visibility into real-time headcounts by contractor, skill, and shift. Plus, you’ll know which equipment and materials are required by contractors and shift.</span></li>
                <li><span style="color: #000000;"> Using access control systems to prevent unrestricted access. This is critical for security and safety, and access control systems can eliminate billing errors and help with a company’s insurance and risk management.</span></li>
                <li><span style="color: #000000;"> Using smart contracts to match work risk to contract type. Smart contracts match work risk to contract type, with Lump Sum contracts, ensuring good scope; Unit Rate contracts, to improve productivity and control costs; Time &amp; Materials work, to address labor, equipment, and materials.</span></li>
                <li><span style="color: #000000;"> Using ERP integration for data entry. After the software approves the invoice for payment, it generates electronic charges that can be updated in the ERP system for settlement.</span></li>

                <p><span style="color: #000000;">A<span style="font-size: 11px;"><span style="font-size: 18px;">sset-heavy industries, whether oil and gas, industrial, or aerospace, have their own unique set of challenges when managing contractor spend and preventing safety incidents. There are so many variables on any project—from long-lead time items to site-specific training requirements. </span></span></span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;">Despite the complexity and economic uncertainty, many plants and sites are heavily invested in paper-based processes. Transitioning from legacy paper systems to digital can seem quite radical. Entrenched resistance to digital automation flies in the face of safety and productivity best practices. </span></p>
                <p style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 22.8pt; padding-left: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;">On a positive note, the <a href="https://www.industryweek.com/white-papers/whitepaper/21263181/industry-insights-responding-to-industry-challenges" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">Endeavor Business Intelligence</a> survey of 120 IndustryWeek members, found that (71%) said their companies have made progress in their digital journeys, including 32% that have digitized a good portion of their operations over the last few years. </span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto" style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000;">However, just 17% of companies have a single, unified system to run their operations on, yet 45% of manufacturers view a single technology ecosystem as either “very” or “extremely” important. The cloud is also gaining ground in the manufacturing sector, where 23% of</span></p>

                <p style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 22.8pt; padding-left: 0in; font-size: 18px;"><span style="color: #000000;">Driving the implementation and adoption of new digital tools can be tricky without strong corporate support. For example, technology and processes are key enablers of downstream operations, but people are the most important of all, said Alex Shelton, director of rotating equipment at Phillips 66, in the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://1.reutersevents.com/LP=33906" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">Downstream Industry Report: 2022 and Beyond</a></span>. “You can have the process, you can have the technology, but they’re doomed to fail if you don’t have the right people involved,” he said. “The bigger piece of that is not just finding the synergies, finding the connections, finding the KPIs—all extremely important—but having good leadership.”</span></p>

                <p><span data-contrast="none">Many heavy-asset companies struggle to hire, train, and retain skilled staff. When it comes to outsourcing different areas of operations and leaning on experts, managed services allow employees to focus on different tasks, value opportunities, and optimization.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Here is a closer look at three benefits when companies embrace managed services:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <ol>
                <li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Arial" data-listid="22" data-list-defn-props="{&quot;335552541&quot;:0,&quot;335559684&quot;:-1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769242&quot;:[65533,0],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;%1.&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="none">Depth of Subject Matter Expertise – </span></strong><span data-contrast="none">Heavy industry is very complex. Managing large projects and sites, like turnarounds, can mean a massive number of suppliers coming on-site. All the focus should be on the work, like changing out a piece of equipment. When you use managed services to help process payments and supplier contracts, you can bring calmness and structure to a chaotic time.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></li>
                </ol>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">By managing those vendor relationships, companies can ensure contract terms are being applied correctly; and there is no leakage. This is particularly helpful when firms know they can be audited at any time. If employees have a backup from subject matter experts provided by an MSP, they can reach out at any time and have questions answered or lean on them for support.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <strong><span data-contrast="none">2. Resource Scalability – </span></strong><span data-contrast="none">Yes, companies can hire individuals to handle a particular task, like approving payments. However, during a high-volume period, it’s helpful if you have the backup to scale up resources depending on the needs of the business</span><strong><span data-contrast="none">. </span></strong><span data-contrast="none">Also, it is critical these resources have access to the training they need.&nbsp;</span></div>
                <div><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span></div>
                <div><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">One of the biggest advantages of using managed services is that you’re not leaning on just one person or a few people. It allows employees to get out of the weeds, such as processing payments, and have a greater impact on the broader business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
                <div><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span><br><span data-contrast="none"></span></div>
                <div><strong><span data-contrast="none">3. Operational Consistency – </span></strong>Everyone<span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-contrast="none">wants to ensure their business is running consistently – even if different locations have different processes. For example, you always want to ensure all the data is entered in the same format. This allows consistent outputs so you can more easily see if you’re compliant in the case of an audit. You can also use this consistent data for future benchmarking. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Over time, the business and its employees can drive impactful change. For example, a company using a contractor spend management solution may discover 60% of over-rides on a given day are due to a malfunctioning card reader at a site. Now, they can see the big picture and fix the broken reader. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">With managed services, employees can troubleshoot and be more strategic in driving optimization because they have an outside team supporting them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p style="font-size: 18px;"><span data-contrast="none">Just how big is the managed service market? Managed services accounted for </span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/managed-services-market-forecast-managed-cloud-services-coming-to-the-fore" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">$48.6 billion</a><span data-contrast="none"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>in 2021 and is expected to reach $73 billion in 2025.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">According to a 2022 study by </span><a href="https://advisory.kpmg.us/services/kpmg-managed-services.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">KPMG</a><span data-contrast="none">, 75% of organizations planned to increase spending on managed services. Of those, 41% use managed services for more than half of their work in IT, cybersecurity, risk, and business performance.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">For example, cloud services can help companies leverage the power of cloud computing without the need for in-house expertise. This is especially helpful when migrating data and applications to the cloud, managing cloud environments, and providing support and optimization.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Another way managed services can be utilized is by providing remote monitoring and control. With the increasing use of IoT-connected devices, MSPs can offer remote monitoring and control services for operators.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">In the oil and gas industry, sensors and monitoring devices can be deployed across remote sites. For example, IoT sensors can monitor for flammable gases and toxic vapors in the atmosphere to help prevent gas leakages and oil spills.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Using an MSP for remote monitoring and control, companies can collect real-time data for insights into equipment performance, and collect environmental and safety data for compliance. This function can help companies proactively identify issues, optimize production, and enhance safety. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><span data-contrast="none">Initially, managed services may have been used for projects narrow in scope or to solve specific business functions. Today, it seems traditional managed services models are evolving, due to labor shortages, risk mitigation, and regulatory challenges.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">According to a </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/de/Documents/operations/Deloitte-Report-Next-Generation-Managed-Services.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">Harvard Business Review Analytic Services White Paper</a><span data-contrast="none"> for Deloitte, the next generation of managed services involves filling skills gaps and providing a competitive advantage.

                <p><span data-contrast="none">Instead of managed services providing static outcomes, the report says businesses are rethinking “build vs. buy” decisions. Managed services can not only help enterprises to standardize or automate repetitive tasks but help to inspire innovation and provide strategic value.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">In the report, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Will Venters, PhD, an associate professor of information systems at the London School of Economics, validates this approach. “It makes sense that the company that helps you implement and integrate a cloud system can also help run it and offer advice on the best way to maximize its use,” he notes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">He adds: </span><span data-contrast="auto">“Many industries have tight labor pools and a competitive market for finding and retaining good talent, which has motivated organizations to contract with managed service providers to supplement their in-house staff.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p>Get ready to elevate your organization's training program to new heights! The MCi Learning and Development team is hard at work, creating a lineup of new, dynamic, and innovative training programs designed to empower your organization. We are thrilled to share that we have an exciting array of programs planned for the coming year, and we can't wait to unveil them for you.<br><br></p> 
                <p>We kicked off our new lineup of training programs on May 2 at Momentum: MCi's All-Access Conference with the debut of our highly anticipated TRACK Trainer Certification Program. Participants had the opportunity to attend a half-day training session led by a diverse and dynamic group of experts from our Consulting team, TaaS, and Learning and Development. They covered crucial topics such as utilizing TRACK University for training and onboarding, creating a Facilitator Guide, and a refresher on the Five A's of the TRACK application. The session provided hands-on learning experiences that were highly beneficial to all attendees.<br><br></p> 
                <p>But that's not all! As a follow-up to the TRACK Trainer Certification Program, we invited the same group of participants to our first-ever TRACK University Virtual Instructor-Led Training, held on May 24. Led by Maria Rivera, Administrator of the Learning Management System, this session, titled "Building a Learning Plan for Digital Learners," focused on creating tailored learning plans in TRACK University. Participants walked through the process of selecting TRACK U courses to develop learning plans specific to their organizations.<br><br></p> 
                <p>Make sure to mark your calendars and attend MCi's next user conference. It will be an incredible opportunity to not only experience the TRACK Trainer Certification Program firsthand but also gain insights from industry experts, network with like-minded professionals, and explore the latest trends and technologies. You won't want to miss it!<br><br></p> 
                <p>To ensure you don't miss out on the exciting new training opportunities, we encourage you to stay tuned to TRACK University for upcoming announcements. Our Learning and Development team is committed to taking your learning journey to new heights. We can't wait to share more details and invite you to participate in these impactful programs.</p>

He shared how he helped to build a safety culture and how safety has evolved in the heavy asset industry. The plant referenced in his comments had roughly a thousand employees, including contractors each day, not including Turnarounds.</span>&nbsp;</span></p>

                   <p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">BRUCE</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: In the early 1980s, we were having major events, even fires, every week at the refinery where I worked. It was so bad the mantra on our shift (I was an operator at the time) was “Let’s just get through our eight hours without an incident and go home.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                   <p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">BRUCE: </span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">A lot of people died in my facility over the 37 years I worked at my first refinery. Unfortunately, some were close friends. Then we had a single event—a major explosion—in one of our sister sites where we lost 13 people</span><strong><span data-contrast="auto">. &nbsp;</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><span data-contrast="auto">Following the event,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">our company got serious about safety. We picked up the slogan “Goal Zero.” I don’t know if it was our own or a spinoff of someone else’s. But it stuck and we created a culture that did not accept or tolerate injuries. We went from a major event and/or fire every week and people dying to zero injuries. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><span data-contrast="auto">At first, many thought it was a bridge too far. Even I couldn’t see how we could get to zero injuries, accidents just happened. But we achieved Goal Zero over several years and adopted new safe work practices. I became one of the biggest champions. By the time I reached the senior level in my career, I was 100% convinced you can work in a zero-incident environment. It took a paradigm shift in how I looked at everything using safety as the first thought in every task.</span></p>

                   <p style="font-size: 24px;"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Q: How did you get buy-in to work toward Goal Zero?</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">BRUCE:</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto"> The first thing we did was to remove taking any disciplinary action from all safety-related events.&nbsp; </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><span data-contrast="auto">We treated every event as an opportunity to learn and built a mitigation plan for all similar future activities.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">We shared with the entire plant the event details, the extent of any injuries, and our mitigation plans. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><span data-contrast="auto">Specific to our contractors, we created a Contractor Safety Council. Once a week, all the safety leaders from each vendor would share every safety event that happened to one of their employees—from a mashed finger to a fall. We’d share it all to learn from it.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><span data-contrast="auto">When the injured employee was willing to share with the group directly, we encouraged it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><span data-contrast="auto">Once we had shared collaboration between vendors to self-report, we went from reporting injuries to that zero-injury state. We used to measure in “Million Safe Hours." I remember reaching a million safe hours, and the entire site celebrated, it was a huge milestone. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><span data-contrast="auto">After Goal Zero, we measured in years as it related to injuries.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><span data-contrast="auto">Then, we began to measure near misses. That was what we wanted to talk about. I remember having a safety stand-down when someone fell off the back of a truck while offloading equipment. We shut all work down to learn and share what had happened. Even though that employee didn’t get hurt. That 4-to-5-foot drop could have killed that individual.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">In an environment where every vendor is in competition for work at my site, we had to create a safety culture where all our 30-plus vendors would share everything, even someone falling off a truck without injury. </span></p> 
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">At my site, we created a safety culture where everyone shared any incidents. We also shared safety practices across companies and shared learning opportunities.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p style="font-size: 24px;"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Q: How critical was support from the top to create a safety culture?</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">BRUCE: </span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">If you don’t have support, you may improve safety statistics, but the culture will never be there. People will continue to take risks, things like crawling out on a pipe to perform a task instead of setting up a scaffold.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Maybe they got lucky a thousand times. Goal Zero is we don’t want you to take that one thousand and one risk of falling out of the pipe rack. Just because you’ve gotten away with it for years, doesn’t mean you’ll get away with it again.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">BRUCE:</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto"> There is a lot of bolted pipe connection work in heavy industry. When you’re working on these pipes with a wrench, the tendency is you want to pull toward you with all your strength. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">If you want to be 100% safe, you will push away from the body, even though you don’t have as much leverage. My front teeth are capped because I busted a tooth doing just that.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Our safety culture would not accept a chipped tooth or someone falling over backward when the bolt breaks loose. You’re eliminating that one-in-a-million event.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">You’ve got to make it personal to move it from “I don’t want injuries at my site so I don’t want YOU to get hurt.”&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Another example: The guy crawling out onto the pipe rack. We had to teach employees to be patient and wait long enough to get a scaffold built or a piece of lift equipment to help them safely gain access.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Employees were no longer in trouble for waiting. In fact, we investigated why we failed to provide access prior to assigning the task.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">When it came to operator tasks, we even trained all operators on the use of Scissor and Man Lifts and then parked them just outside of the units so they could use them as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p style="font-size: 24px;"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Q: What was your biggest worry or safety concern on the job?</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">BRUCE: </span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">The biggest challenge was new employees to the site. We would try to identify new employees, with things like different color hard hats or markings on their hard hats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">There are two types of newness: Brand new to the site but in the business for several years but they needed to learn your safety culture. The highest-risk employee is brand new to the industry and has never been to a plant site. Both types of people you want to identify for those employees working around them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">The culture became when you see someone identified as new, you make sure they’re doing things right so that person doesn’t hurt themselves or hurt you. For example: make sure they’re not standing on a pump base to reach something or make sure their ladder is tied off, so it becomes second nature to that new person.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">With hundreds of employees on site every day, we were doing everything possible to support and encourage people to do the right thing every time.

                <p style="font-size: 24px;"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Q: How did TRACK help with safety?</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">BRUCE: </span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">Two of the most important things for me were: The ratio of entry-level skilled employees and supervisors to crafts.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">TRACK allowed me to measure both easily. You can go into TRACK and run a skill report and see the skill levels. Whether they were a carpenter or pipefitter, it was important to know their skill levels. You could make sure a vendor wasn’t inundating you with helper class workers. The entry-level skilled person is the highest-risk person in the crew. I wanted my supervisor ratio to be about 6- or 8-to-1. Making sure I had enough field supervisors to ensure safe efficient work. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p style="font-size: 24px;"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Q: How has managing fatigue thresholds changed?</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">BRUCE: </span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">Before TRACK, we used an Excel spreadsheet to keep up with who had exceeded the number of hours or days they were on the job. It was a nightmare and there were no automated email alerts. With TRACK, you have automated email alerts and fatigue dashboards, so you get an alert when someone is nearing and/or exceeding their thresholds.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">In the past, employees didn’t tell their supervisors they were exceeding the fatigue guidelines. Now, employees are held accountable for following the fatigue guidelines because TRACK is providing managers with a tool to make sure what they put in place is being adhered to.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">The fatigue management tool TRACK provides is amazing. Without it, there was no notification or proactive monitoring.

                <p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">BRUCE:</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto"> My role in our Emergency Operations Center was the logistics coordinator and I needed to account for and know the location of every maintenance and support person in the plant. I would sometimes need to move resources in response to the event. They may request electricians so I would have to find the right electricians and ask them to go address an issue, like a live wire. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Pre-TRACK, I didn’t have any real-time visibility of where people were in the facility. I would have to go to security and ask where people are located. Or I was on the phone or radio calling people.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">My plant covered over 700 acres with a dozen rally points so I would have to call or radio asking about who was at each rally point—by name and company. Then, I compared and matched the names to a daily force report. For example, a fire may burn for two hours and it’s out before I’ve accounted for everyone. It was an absolute nightmare.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">After TRACK, it’s a different world. I seldom had to ask anyone about the location of people. I pull up TRACK to see where people scanned. I know who is in the facility, who has exited, and who is at what rally point. With card readers at every rally point, I could account for most employees in just a few minutes. I could then focus on who was missing. But the heavy lifting was done with TRACK. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                   <p><span data-contrast="auto">In this era of Industry 4.0, the benefits of automation are touted at every turn. It may be hard to believe that paper-based timesheets are still a big part of how owners and vendors in the heavy asset industry get work done.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                   <p><span data-contrast="auto">From refineries to chemical plants to mines, it is not uncommon to use paper and manual timesheets to validate proof of presence for contracted services. This involves </span><span data-contrast="none">tedious confirmations and manual service entry sheets that are </span><span data-contrast="auto">prone to errors and inaccuracies. It is especially difficult to verify daily hours worked while juggling labor classifications, multiple pay rates, and unique contracts.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><span data-contrast="auto">Often, timesheets for labor, equipment, and materials are signed off by field supervisors as a backup during the invoicing process. Often a foreman reports hours for their crew by glancing at their watch or rounding up to the nearest hour.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><span data-contrast="auto">As a result, there is no way to accurately verify labor, material, and equipment charges, which can lead to after-the-fact reconciliations. How do you pay contractors accurately when field supervisors rarely have visibility into agreed-upon skill requirements and contract terms?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p> 
                   <p><span data-contrast="auto">Often, the time being approved may not be accurate or based on gate log data without the knowledge of the accountable party. It is also not a great use of crew time to chase down the accountable party on-site—especially if the person is in the field managing multiple jobs in various locations.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> {{cta('3ca3f67e-c55e-4044-aea4-ee61da95a549','justifycenter')}}</span></p>

                   <p><span data-contrast="auto">Those who&nbsp;use paper timesheets do so for many reasons—from simplicity to familiarity.

                <p><span data-contrast="none">Companies that leverage a contractor data management solution can prevent discrepancies and error-proof their invoice accuracy.

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">First, there is pressure to deliver on tough carbon reduction goals – such as achieving net zero by 2050. Next, there is the opportunity to profit from the growing demands for the very materials needed to achieve net zero, such as supplying lithium, cobalt, and nickel to support the next generation of electric vehicles. Lastly, going green comes with expensive up-front costs, such as removing diesel engines from sites.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Leaky contracts refer to agreements with contractors and suppliers that have gaps, ambiguities, or inconsistencies that lead to disputes, delays, and additional costs.

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">For example, your contracts may be drafted with well-defined scope, objectives, and deliverables.

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Specifically, terms and conditions set everything from quality standards to schedules, payment terms, and performance.

                <p><span data-contrast="auto"> Signed into law in August 2022, the IRA is the third piece of U.S. legislation passed in the past two years that aims to improve U.S. economic competitiveness, innovation, and industrial productivity. The funds will be delivered through tax incentives, grants, and loan guarantees.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Although the IRA’s incentives for clean electricity infrastructure investments and electric vehicles are getting the lion’s share of the headlines, the legislation offers benefits related to the workforce as well. The act is designed to ensure Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wages are paid to workers on such projects and registered apprenticeships are utilized.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-ccp-props="{}">Perhaps one of the best ways to ensure your business can qualify for these benefits is by using a contractor data management solution like the <span style="color: #073763;"><a href="https://www.managementcontrols.com/track" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #073763;">TRACK®</a></span> platform. As you'll see, TRACK is a perfect fit for businesses that need a seamless way to demonstrate&nbsp;they qualify for these credits as detailed below.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"></span></p>

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Legislators established the program to allocate tax credits for qualified investments in eligible advanced energy projects including clean energy manufacturing and recycling, greenhouse gas emission reduction, and critical materials refining, reprocessing, and recycling.

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">I am a single 52-year-old with two children who are 34 and 30. I have a grandson who is 3, and he is my world.

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">I like the fact that all of your information can be uploaded into TRACK and available for you to allocate your time, materials, and equipment.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">Everyone learns differently, and the videos are great, especially when you’re in a pinch and need a refresher on how to do something particular in TRACK. You have the option to go back and look at the videos.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">If you’re not sure of something, ask. You can always refer to the TRACK training videos (in TRACK University) as well. And most importantly……Breathe!! You’ve got this, and you will be ok. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><strong><span data-contrast="none">MIKE: </span></strong><span data-contrast="none">When we talk about commercial strategy, you have to remember our current and future customers have physical sites all around the world performing work in various industrial verticals. They have assets - buildings, sites, and machines that produce these goods. These assets need to be maintained.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Just because a company is good at making the goods doesn't mean they know how to fix the machinery that produces them. They also may not be able to spare the workforce.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">When a company has to procure services from vendors to maintain its assets, a commercial strategy comes into place.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;"><span data-contrast="none" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US">Q: What challenges are involved in the process? </span></p>
                <p><strong><span data-contrast="none">MIKE: </span></strong><span data-contrast="none">It’s a challenge for the two parties – owners and contractors -- to agree on the commercials. In some cases, it involves two Fortune 500 companies coming together to gain common ground who have completely different business models.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">For those two organizations to come together and agree on how they're going to reimburse work for the assets the owners are trying to maintain, it can get precarious. The service contractors are coming into a manufacturing facility that's owned and managed by the owner.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">They don't control any of the variables, such as the environment, atmosphere, time of day, time of week, time of year that they're in there, condition of the equipment that they're working on, or safety requirements that the owner requires. insurance requirements that the owner requires, etc.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">And it's not as simple as saying, "I'll go give you a pipe fitter to fix your pipe for $50.00 an hour," because as a contractor, you don't know how many pipe fitters they're going to need.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Where's the pipe? How big is the pipe? What are the conditions surrounding the pipe? What kind of insurance requirements do I need to have?

                <p><strong><span data-contrast="none">MIKE</span></strong><span data-contrast="none">: It's a two-step process. The companies must negotiate the commercials of how they're going to interact with one another, meaning what's required when the vendor comes on-site, what they need to have, when they can work, and how many people they can bring.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">There's a strategy that you pick from the commercials you've negotiated that should be based on the type of work you're doing. So, before you can pick a strategy, you have to define what's being done, or the scope, and that’s a struggle.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">But there’s a conundrum. I need something, but I don't know what I need. I just know the asset is not doing what it's supposed to do. So, I need to hire an expert service contractor to come and fix it. You're not going to have a scope of work because you don't know what to do. So, you're completely reliant upon the contractor coming in and defining your scope of work.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">This puts the owner at a disadvantage.

                <p><span data-contrast="none">According to </span><span style="color: #073763;"><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/contracting-for-performance-unlocking-additional-value" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #073763;">McKinsey</a></span><span data-contrast="none">, many heavy-asset businesses, including refineries, have 90% or more of their annual revenues represented in contracts with suppliers and vendors. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Interestingly, they note the majority don’t invest their limited resources in contract development and vendor management. Total procurement operating expenses are typically less than 1% of total spending. As a result, McKinsey says, suboptimal contract terms and conditions can erode up to 9% of annual revenues.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="auto">In this busy turnaround season, how can owners and third-party contractors get more value out of their relationships and contracts? Even powerhouse producers can struggle with how they manage their contractor spend data.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><span data-contrast="auto">What causes many of these issues? McKinsey says a lack of oversight and contract management. If a large procurement group must execute and monitor tens of thousands of contracts annually, the sheer volume means ownership of these contracts tends to shift contractor management to those in the field requiring the product or service. Many of these contracts are managed by users who are not trained to do so. McKinsey found 80% of procurement functions are not fully aware of competitive terms and conditions.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <div>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">In the heavy-asset industry, the shift towards digitalization has been occurring steadily. Many small companies dip their toe in and update systems as they scale. Large companies in asset-heavy sectors may incorporate technology to increase efficiencies, reduce errors, and gain a competitive advantage. This can range from ERP systems to IIoT to robotics and automation. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Often, this piecemeal approach leads to a hodgepodge of systems. The mix may include legacy systems, outdated technology, and reliance on manual data analysis. Integrating every device, application, and process offers multiple benefits.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">If you’re under pressure to deliver projects on time and on budget—from maintenance to turnarounds and outages—you’ll need technology that integrates and has an open API for your greatest chance at success.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <h2><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}"><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN" lang="EN">Why Technology and Systems Should Integrate</span>&nbsp;</span></h2>

                <div>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Navigating a digital roadmap can be challenging for many in the heavy-asset industries, such as refineries, paper mills, utilities, and mines. Determining which tech options to integrate and mixing them with manual solutions may lessen the benefits of some solutions. Integration typically creates complexity, increases cost, and makes it challenging to streamline processes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">The term <span style="color: #073763;"><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/industry-4-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #073763;">Industry 4.0</a></span></span> <span data-contrast="none">is "synonymous with smart manufacturing” and “… is the realization of the digital transformation of the field.” In essence, it represents the tangible execution of the digital evolution within the sector.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">According to </span><span style="color: #073763;"><a href="https://www.manufacturingdive.com/spons/automation-everywhere-is-key-to-manufacturing-scalability/647158/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #073763;">Manufacturing Dive</a></span><span data-contrast="none">, “Manufacturing IT teams face ongoing challenges as organizations embark on Industry 4.0 initiatives to digitalize the existing infrastructure to adapt to new products and markets dynamically.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><span data-contrast="none">An open API is an application<em> </em>programming interface made publicly available to software developers.</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">While the directive for seamless tech integration in asset-heavy industries is clear, its practical implementation is far from simple. The challenge arises because there are a limited number of software systems that perform all the tasks your business needs to accomplish. And the systems most applicable to performing the exact tasks may fail the connectivity test. If your ERP, CMMS, access control, HR/payroll, etc. systems don’t connect, the new technology could be a hindrance. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">When choosing new systems for your asset-heavy-industry business, leaders should choose software that integrates and has an open API</span>.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Note integration and API are not the same, but both are critical for data access. “APIs often enable the transfer of data between systems. “… systems also use APIs more broadly to enable one system to access another for non-data transfer reasons. As a result, some APIs do not enable integrations,” explains </span><span style="color: #073763;"><a href="https://prismatic.io/blog/api-vs-integration/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #073763;">Prismatic</a></span><span data-contrast="none">, a software development company.

                <p><span data-contrast="none">Let’s review some of the benefits of an open API.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <strong><span data-contrast="none">1. Integration and Interoperability:</span></strong><span data-contrast="none"> One of the primary benefits of open APIs is seamless communication and data sharing between systems. Systems and applications that have open APIs can communicate and share data seamlessly. This empowers businesses to maximize the value of their data.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span><br>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">For example, an automotive manufacturing plant may use asset management software, a maintenance system, and a scheduling system.</span><span data-contrast="none"> Without integration, the three systems operate in isolation, which could cause problems if the equipment is overused and breaks down.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">In this case, you’ll gain better asset utilization and reduced downtime because the information flows between systems.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">And if data is siloed? Data that stays in one department/area is limited in its value and impact.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}"> </span></p>
                <p><strong style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"><span data-contrast="none">2. Scalability:</span></strong><span data-contrast="none" style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;"> Transitioning from legacy systems or outdated technology to more modern systems can be expensive and complex. The process may happen slowly due to a few factors, including cost and the time it takes companies to realize the full benefits and recognize the potential gains. Transitions tend to be bumpy.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}" style="background-color: transparent; letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">For example, Boeing, one of the world's largest aerospace manufacturers, faced a substantial challenge when it decided to upgrade its manufacturing systems. Their legacy systems were a patchwork of outdated hardware and software that couldn't keep up with the increasing complexity of designing and producing modern aircraft. Today, they are the epitome of a </span><span style="color: #073763;"><a href="https://simpleflying.com/boeing-smart-factories-advanced-manufacturing-techniques-guide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #073763;">smart factory</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span></span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">As your asset-heavy business grows and/or you determine it's necessary to integrate more technology into your processes, a plan is essential. Ensuring that each component of the tech stack will have an open API will make it easier (and less costly) to scale in the long run.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Open APIs also make it easier to scale and add new features without disrupting existing operations. This scalability can be crucial for companies dealing with large and complex operations{{cta('5c7278db-8312-4050-8081-4b061233ce22')}}</span></p>
                <strong><span data-contrast="none">3. Innovation and Future-Proofing:</span></strong><span data-contrast="none"> While technology without an open API might address immediate needs, it can hinder future integrations. However, it could also ultimately delay further integration of technology.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Why? Sunk costs. Replacing useful and costly technology is a tough call. Therefore, businesses may stick with technology until they feel they’ve recouped their investment. If, for example, a closed API ERP does not integrate with other technology, such as used for HR/payroll, teams may hold off on buying new technology and continue to rely on dated systems.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">On the other hand, open APIs enable asset-heavy organizations to stay competitive by adopting new technologies and innovations quickly. Businesses can integrate cutting-edge solutions and adapt to industry trends without a complete software overhaul.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <strong><span data-contrast="none">4. Cost-Efficiency:</span></strong><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp; In an era of escalating costs, open APIs offer cost-saving advantages. Anything that can help maintain or even reduce budgets is most welcome.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Open APIs can lead to cost savings by reducing the need to develop and maintain custom, in-house software solutions. Developing an in-house solution is time-consuming and costly, and it results in an unproven product that typically has a short shelf life. This is a poor return on workforce resources that have a limited amount of time. Putting a workforce in the best position to succeed lowers costs.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">For example, </span><span style="color: #073763;"><a href="https://www.oilandgasiq.com/digital-transformation/articles/how-bp-and-chevron-use-digital-twins-to-optimize-assets" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #073763;">BP and Chevron</a></span><span data-contrast="none"> leaned into digital twins with open APIs for their digital transformation.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Instead of reinventing the wheel, asset-heavy companies can leverage existing software platforms and build on them through API integrations. This takes less time and is more likely to result in a long-lasting and useful product.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <strong><span data-contrast="none">5. Data Accessibility and Analysis:</span></strong><span data-contrast="none"> Data is invaluable for its insights. Why do companies crave data? It’s the insights that can be gleaned which can impact decisions, both major and minor. Data can help asset-heavy companies be more proactive, rather than reactive, and proceed in a more beneficial direction for the business. That’s why, in the case of access to data, “the more the merrier” is not a trite saying.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Open APIs facilitate access to valuable data stored within different systems, enabling better data analysis, reporting, and decision-making. This can result in improved asset management, predictive maintenance, and resource optimization.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Decision-makers can move forward with more confidence because there are few surprises. They’ve made the decision based on all available data and analysis.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><strong>BRUCE:</strong><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;As part of implementing myTrack, Management Controls (MCi) provides our clients with examples of recommended best practices for things they should include in their contracts. Some examples of vagueness include how people will get paid if there are weather delays, if vendors will get paid a minimum show-up pay on the weekends, off-site fueling, etc. Generally, organizations that do not use myTrack have insufficient details in their contracts, which leads to uncertainty and over-payments.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Someone in procurement might feel there is no vagueness in the terms and conditions because they wrote the contract and understand the intent of what was agreed to. But are they addressing all the different scenarios that can take place in the field?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">However, the people responsible for administrating the<span style="color: #073763;"><a href="/10-ways-leaky-contracts-can-hurt-your-business" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #073763;"> contracts</a></span>, such as site managers, turnaround managers, maintenance managers, and supervisors, have likely never seen the contract, so they do not know the terms and conditions.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Consider a vendor who submits an invoice for a weather delay. The person signing the ticket does not know if they're eligible for a weather delay. When a ticket gets invoiced, it gets paid because the people in accounting don't know what was in the contract or intended to be in the contract, so they pay the invoice.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Yet, you cannot contest something if it wasn’t in the contract or spelled out. If you do choose to contest, it's going to be a big headache. This leads to frustration between the two parties.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">myTrack helps you improve the partnership with your vendors because it results in a specific contract without ambiguity. It helps remove the mistrust over billing "intentional or unintentional” and puts everybody on the same page.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}"> {{cta('5c7278db-8312-4050-8081-4b061233ce22')}}</span></p>

                <p><strong><span data-contrast="none">BRUCE:   </span></strong><span data-contrast="none">Let’s say you have a project close-out in August, and you think everything is done, but an invoice shows up in December. You thought you had accounted for everything, but unfortunately, the vendors did not turn in some of their timesheets.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">The only way to check if the project close-out is complete is to do a manual audit against the gates. That means checking the gate logs, which show the hundreds of people who worked on your project. It’s a nightmare.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Invoices for large sums of money can be submitted months later. Vendors might not even realize they failed to submit everything until their auditors are going to close out the project. Despite the project being long since finished in your system and books closed, you're obligated to pay those dollars since they were on your site.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">These issues do not occur with myTrack because it audits everybody who comes through the gate every day. You know today what happened through yesterday. Even if the vendor doesn't invoice, you still know they were there, so you owe them money. As a result, you won't close out the project because you know you are waiting on an invoice from that vendor. This can be viewed in real-time, and it is 100% accurate.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">myTrack tells the vendor you have earned this much money for this number of people because it sees everyone that comes in, knows their skills, knows their schedules, and connects everyone to the terms and conditions of that particular vendor contract.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><strong>BRUCE: </strong><span data-contrast="none">Many companies think they have a firm grasp on this and convince themselves they audit their gate 100%. Many use a manual system such as an Excel spreadsheet for comparing gate logs to timesheets.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">For some companies, the contractor who is invoicing them performs the audit. It's then verified by internal supervisors who can’t possibly confirm all the information.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><strong style="font-size: 24px; background-color: transparent; font-family: Roboto; letter-spacing: 0px;">4. Question: What about a lack of verification for equipment and material charges?</strong></p>
                <p><strong><span data-contrast="none">BRUCE: </span></strong><span data-contrast="none">Consider this scenario: you hire a vendor and tell them, "I'm going to let you bring in five pickup trucks, four welding machines, and four air compressors to do this project." They give you a price for each, and you agree. The vendor submits the invoice for the equipment/machinery, but you do not see the invoice or sign for it. There are no controls to ensure the vendor adheres to the agreed-upon payment terms (and quantities). </span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">myTrack empowers the person responsible for the equipment and material to review the allocations and hold the vendor accountable for what was agreed upon. It also allows you to make real-time adjustments to the amount of equipment needed to complete the work. You must no longer rely on the vendors to provide you with a list of equipment for your job.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">Another significant advantage is that myTrack applies the lowest cost possible for each piece of equipment based on the contract terms and conditions. It looks at the unique equipment identifier and applies the lowest rate. Even if somebody signed for seven daily rates, but the contract says you are on a weekly rate, it automatically takes it back to the lower weekly rate.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><strong><span data-contrast="none">BRUCE:</span></strong><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span>This is extremely relevant to people with titles such as maintenance manager, turnaround manager, or project manager. They are responsible for budgets and are signing for things all the time. They’re paying the bills but don’t get to see the invoice. The invoice shows up on the company’s software, and it takes a few weeks to settle. When it does, maybe it matches what the manager thinks they spent. It's more common that it doesn't.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span data-contrast="none">When time is approved with myTrack, it creates an authorized timesheet inside of myTrack. Vendors could use the myTrack-authorized timesheet as their invoice if they choose so it's an exact match to what should be invoiced. Managers should require accounting to match the myTrack timesheet with the vendor invoice prior to processing. By following this recommendation, there's never any discrepancy. Invoices are now verified and managers will not be surprised by late invoicing.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
